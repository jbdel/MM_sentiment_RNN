BUT I CAN SAFELY ASSURE YOU THAT EVEN IF THEY DIDNT IT WOULD STILL BE A HIT
AND I LOVED IT
I DONT KNOW IF FANS OF THE COMIC WOULD BE AS INCLINED TO SAY THE SAME BECAUSE I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IT DIFFERS FROM THE COMIC OR RADIO PROGRAM THAT PEOPLE LIKE SO MUCH
BUT JUST GOING INTO THIS A AS AN OBSERVER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA IT WAS A FANTASTIC FILM IT WAS SO MUCH FUN
AND I WOULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT WAS HILARIOUS
IT WAS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
AND MOST OF YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
AND HE FUNNIED UP THIS MOVIE BIG TIME TOTALLY
SO THAT DOESNT SURPRISE ME
AND THE HUMOR IT WAS KIND OF NECESSARY
I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WOUDLNT HAVE INSERTED THE HUMOR INTO THIS MOVIE IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST TOO SERIOUS AND KIND OF BORING IN A SENSE
BUT THE HUMOR REALLY JUST NAILED IT
AND THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE TENSED
I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS
WHEN THEY JUST COME UP WITH THESE TOTALLY COMPLETELY NEW STYLIZED WAYS OF DEVELOPING ACTION SEQUENCES
COZ SURE ITS FUN TO SEE A SUPER HERO GO ROUND AND KICK BAD GUY BUTT YOU KNOW PUNCH KICK WHATEVER BAM
BUT WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO INTERPRET THIS
AND ADD SOMETHING LIKE AN EXTRA SPARK IN THERE
THAT MAKES IT MORE VISUALLY TRULY APPEALING
AND JUST DIFFERENT
IT ENGAGES THE AUDIENCE MORE
AND I JUST REALLY ENJOYED IT
THE GREEN HORNET DID SOMETHING SIMILAR
BUT THEY TOOK A NEW SPIN ON IT
AND I JUST LOVED IT
AND I FEEL LIKE EVEN THOUGH THE FIGHTING SEQUENCES WERE A LITTLE BIT LONG IN SOME PLACES T
SO I MEANT IF I WAS WEARING 0D GLASSES AND WAS SEEING THIS IN 0D I WOULDVE ENJOYED IT A LOT MORE
AND I WOULD WANT THE SEQUENCES TO BE EVEN LONGER RATHER THAN SHORTER
NOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE BASICALLY SAYS IT ALL
NOW IM NOT EVEN GONNA SUGAR COAT THIS THIS MOVIE FRUSTRATED ME TO SUCH AN EXTREME EXTENT THAT I WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMING WHY AT THE END OF THE FILM
MY REASON IM A COMIC BOOK FAN
THAT LIKE TO SEE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS TREATED RESPONSIBLY
THAT HUH BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THAT I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAD A SURPRISINGLY DECENT CAST
STRANGE SINCE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GRAPES WITH THE XMAN SERIES WAS AND ALWAYS IS THE XXX
NOW HUGH JACKMAN WAS ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE TO PLAY WOLVERINE I WILL ADMIT THAT
AND IN MY OPINION HE CARRIED THE MOVIE FINE
YOU KNOW NOTHING GREAT
BUT YOU KNOW HE DID IT
HES A STAR OF THE MOVIE
NOTHING SPECIAL
HE CARRIED IT
WHICH IS A SMART MOVE SINCE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE REAL COMIC BOOK FAN TO GET WHAT HES NAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE
BUT ITS PRETTY SELFEXPLANATORY
UM I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LIEV SCHREIBER IS A GOOD ACTOR
AND HE ALMOST LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THIS CHARACTER IN DEFIANCE
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO LAZY TO TAKE OFF THE COSTUME OR SOMETHING
NOW OTHER PERFORMANCES ARE BORDERLINE
OK BUT THE TWO BIG CHARACTER APPEARANCES IN THIS MOVIE ARE EASILY DEADPOOL AND GAMBIT
ACTUALLY I LIKED HIM A LOT
AND I THOUGHT HE MADE A GOOD ACTOR FOR THE DEAD POOR CHARACTER
NOW HES SEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY SOLD ME
I MEAN THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE
I LIKED THAT SCENE WHERE HE HAD A SWORDS IN THERE AND THERES BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA SHOOT HIM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM TAKE HIM DOWN TAKE HIM DOWN BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM TAKE THAT WITH MY MAGICAL SWORDS
BUT FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT FEEL LIKE IT
UM I LOVED THE VERY FIRST ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS MOVIE
BECAUSE IT HAD A REAL NOSTALGIC FEEL TO IT
IT REMINDED ME OF GETTING UP ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND EATING FRUIT LOOPS AND UM WATCHING CARTOONS
BUT YOU KNOW FOR THIS ONE I JUST DIDNT CARE
UM I SAW NO REASON WHY THEY NEEDED TO BRING BACK THE VILLAIN FROM THE FIRST ONE
AND UM WHILE THE TRAILER MADE THE FILM LOOK REAL NICE AND CUTE
IT WAS JUST FLAT
UM IM SURE KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
KIDS ARE GONNA LOVE THE FILM
BUT FOR ME I WAS JUST A LITTLE BORED
SURE THERE WERE CUTE MONEY PARTS IN THE MIXTING OF THE FILM
BUT OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW
I DIDNT EVEN CARE FOR IT
AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE AVERAGE
LETS FACE IT THEY ARE REALLY NOT MASTER PIECES
I THOUGHT TWILIGHT DIRECTED BY CATHERINE HARDWICKE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY RATHER ENJOYABLE
UM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT HAD ITS FLAWS
BUT CINEMATICLY I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD QUITE GOOD
IT WASIT WAS ENJOYABLE
I WASNT THINKING ON HEARING THAT CHRIS WEITZ WAS GONNA START THE NEW MOON BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT WAS PHILLIP PULLMAN THE GOLDEN COMPASS
I THOUGHT THAT FILM WAS AWFUL
AND I I DIDINT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM NEW MOON UM IN TERMS OF HIS DIRECTION
OVERALL NEW MOON WAS IT WAS OK JUST AVERAGE
THE THING IS ITS A VERY GOOD TRANSLATION OF THE BOOK
ITS VERY VERY LOYAL TO THE BOOK
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOYALTY
UM HOWEVER IT IS THIS LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE THAT GIVES IT ITS FLAWS
AND THE BOOK IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER
I MEAN THE ENTIRE XXX IS BELLA SWAN KRISTEN KRISTENS STEWARDS CHARACTER MOBBING AROUND COMPLETELY DEPRESSED
IT WASNT REALLY THE BEST THE MOST THRILLING READ EVER ILL SAY THAT
SO OVERALLNEW MOON EVEN WITH THE BIGGER BETTER BUDGETS HUH IT WAS STILL TOO LONG
THE ANGSTY TOO ANGSTY MOMENTS WITHDRAWN OUT TO THE MAX AS FAR AS THAY CAN GO
AND THE SCRIPT IT LEFT ALL THE KEY PLOTS AND EMOTION FROM THE CHARACTERS TO BE EXPOSED THROUGH DIALOGUE
I THINK IT WAS EMPIRE MAGAZINES REVIEW OF NEW MOON THAT SAID THAT KRISTEN RELIED HEAVILY ON THE TACTIC OF TACTIC OF BLINKING A LOT WHICH SHE REALLY DOES DO A LOT
BUT AT THE SAME GOES FOR ROB PATTINSON AS EDWARD AND TAYLOR LAUTNER AS JACOB THEY DO A LOT OF FROWNING IM A MANLY MAN AND I FROWN
FOR THE MOMENT IN THIS THE WHOLE CINEMA WAS LAUGHTING
AND YOU KNEW YOU SHOULDNT BE LAUGHING
MY FAVORITE SCENE WOULD DEFINATELY BE THE VOLTURI
UM THEN MY WINS ON SCREEN WISKERS I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY WORN IN A LOTS WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THOUGHT XXX REALLY RATHER GOOD
AND UM MICHAEL SHEEN AS ARO AS WELL HE WAS RATHER ENJOYABLE TO WATCH
AND I THINK THE VOLTURI THAT WAS MY EXCITING BIT OF THE ENTIRE FILM
THE REST OF THE FILM WAS JUST WATCHING KRISTEN JUST MOB AROUND
AND THAT WAS REALLY BORING
BEFORE I WENT IN TO SEE THE GREEN LANTERN IVE BEEN HEARING ALL THESE LIKE CRITICS BASICALLY JUST TRASHING THIS MOVIE LEFT AND RIGHT
BUT I AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANNA JUST SAY THAT I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE
I ENJOYED IT FOR WHAT IT WAS YOU KNOW
ITS A HUGE SORT OF SPECTACLE MOVIE THAT IS GREAT FOR THIS SUMMER TIME YOU KNOW
THIS IS A MOVIE THAT YOURE GONNA GO OUT AND SEE
AND YOU WANNA SEE IT IN 0D
BECAUSE I I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THIS PROBABLY IS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES THIS YEAR THAT IVE SEEN THIS YEAR THAT YOU WANNA SEE IN 0D ESPECIALLY FOR JUST THE OPENING PORTION
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
AND THE REST OF IT DOES LOOK GOOD AS WELL
AND I JUST HAD FUN WATCHING THIS MOVIE
ITS NOT LIKE A DARK MOVIE OR ANYTHING
ITS VERY MUCH A LIGHT HEARTED
SO ITS PERFECT FOR KIDS AS WELL AS JUST LIKE TEENAGERS AS WELL WHO JUST WANNA SEE A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS AND SOME CRAZY STUFF
AND YOU KNOW GOING INTO IT OR THESE WATCHING THE TRAILERS BEFORE HEAD I WAS REALLY KIND OF HESITANT ABOUT SEEING THE GREEN LANTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON
IM NOT REALLY A HUGE FAN OF HAVING LIKE ALL THESE 0D CHARACTERS
BECAUSE I THINK WHY NOT JUST MAKE THIS YOU KNOW MOVIE THIS LIVE ACTION MOVIE AND TALK CARTOON
THATS REALLY THE ROUTE THAT YOURE GONNA GO
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GONNA GO THAT ROUTE
BUT I THINK THERE WAS ALSO SOME SORT OF LIKE UM TONE WITHIN THE ACTUAL UM POWERS OF THE GREEN LANTERN AND HIMSELF AND THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY THINK UP OF ANYTHING AND YOU CAN PROJECT THAT INTO THE REAL LIFE
AND I THINK HAVING THIS SORT OF SUPERPOWER ALMOST THIS POWER TO JUST IMAGINE ANYTHING KIND OF JUST UM HELPED ME GET PASSED THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL CGI CHARACTERS AND SET
THIS IS A PLAYGROUND AND THEIR IMAGINARY PLAYGROUND AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ANYTHING THAT WHAT ALSO MADE THE FILM EXCITING
BECAUSE YOU DONT ENTIRELY KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT
BUT THEN YOU KIND OF LIKE WALK OUT OF THE MOVIE AND YOURE LIKE WELL I I GET WHAT HAPPENED I UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED
BUT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR GREEN LANTERN MOVIE 0 THAT WOULD BE EVEN LIKE WORTH WHILE NOW
BECAUSE I MEAN IF HES ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS SORT OF STUFF LIKE HOW YOURE SUPPOSED TO REALLY PUT UP A FORCE THAT CAN PUSH HIM TO THE NEXT LEVEL OR OR DESTROY HIM AT THE SAME TIME
AND IT DOES KIND OF A LEA HELPS ALLEVIATE WHAT THAT WHOLE WAS IS ABOUT FIGHTING THE ULTIMATE ENEMY WITHIN THIS FIRST MOVIE AND THAT THE THREAT IS STILL THERE POTENTIALLY SPEAKING
SO ITS KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE UM WHERE THEYRE GONNA BE GOING WITH THAT
IM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IVE GOT TO SAY
ITS NOT LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN IS THE NEXT BATMAN BEGINS OR OR THE DARK NIGHTER
MUCH SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
THERE WAS A LOT OF FUN
YOU GUYS DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE GONNA GO AND SEE WHEN YOU GO WALK INTO THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
IF YOURE EXPECTING SOME ARTSY SERIOUS OSCAR CONTENDER THAN YOURE WRONG
THE ONLY OSCAR THAT I CAN EVEN THING OF IS MAYBE LIKE BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
BECAUSE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVIE IS GREAT
AND MAYBE BEST VISUAL EFFECTS
COZ THE VISUAL EFFECTS ARE PRETTY COOL
BUT AGAIN YOU YOU CANT EXPECT A HUGE LIKE SURREAL MIND BENDER FROM THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS YO
AND ITS SATISFACTORY
THE ACTION IS REALLY INTENSE WHICH SURPRISED ME
I DIDNT EXPECT THE ACTION TO BE SO INTENSE
THERES SOME REALLY INTENSE ACTION SCENES ESPECIALLY THE SCENE WHEN THE ALIENS FIRST INVADE
THAT SCENE IS LIKE CRAZY
IT GAVE ME CHILLS
I ITS A LOT OF FUN
THE ACTION IS REALLY COOL
THE ALIENS ARE REALLY COOL
ONE THING I LIKE WITH THE ALIENS IS THAT A THEY ARE NOT JUST WEAK LINKS THAT HIDE BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY
THEY ARE HUGE
THEYRE REALLY STRONG
AND THEYRE KIND OF SCARY LOOKING
I DIDNT EXPECT THAT
AND ALSO I LIKE HOW ITS KIND OF UPFRONT TO SHOW THEM TO US INSTEAD OF HIDING THEM LIKE SHOWING A LITTLE LIKE AN ARM ON SCENE OR SOMETHING NO THEY JUST STRAIGHT UP SHOW IT TO US
AND I REALLY ENJOYED THAT
I IT WAS REALLY COOL WHEN THEY DID THAT
COZ THE ALIENS WERE REALLY COOL LOOKING
DANIEL CRAIG DOES A VERY GOOD JOB HERE
HE KIND OF CHANNELS THE MAN WITH NO NAME CLINT EASTWOOD
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
I THINK HE DOES A GREAT JOB AT WHAT HE DOES
HES A REALLY BAD ASS
IS REALLY REALLY HARD CORE
HE DOESNT TAKE CRAP FROM ANYBODY
AND HE DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB
ALSO HIS INNOCENT ACCENT IS PRETTY CONVINCING
HARRISON FORD IS ALSO GOOD
HES HE GIVES AN ENTERTAINING PERFORMANCE AS THE KIND OF LIKE THE LEADER THE OF THE TOWN
AT FIRST HES JUST KIND OF LIKE GRUMPY OLD GUY
BUT HE BECOMES MORE LIKEABLE
HIS GUTS DEVELOPED MORE AS MORE LIKEABLE CHARACTER
SO YOU CAN CARE ABOUT HIM
AND ALSOUM OLIVIA WILD SHES PRETTY GOOD
SHES BEAUTIFUL
AND SHES NOT A BAD ACTOR
SHES ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
SHES IN EVERYTHING NOWADAYS
THERE ARE SOME FLAWS HERE
AND THERE BUT THEYRE NOT HUGE GLARING FLAWS
BUT THEY ARE NOTICABLE FLAWS
SUCH AS SOMETIMES THE ALIENS IN THE WESTERN SETTING DO LOOK A LITTLE GOOFY
BUT I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING THAT
I WASNT A HUGE FAN OF IT
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID
AND SOMETIMES IT KIND OF VEERS INTO CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY
LIKE A MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK WOULD BE KIND OF LIKE CRAZY
BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST VEERS ENTIRELY CLICHE ACTION MOVIE TERRITORY AGAIN
NOT A HUGE FLAW BUT ITS THERE AND ITS NOTICABLE
OVERALL I REALLY ENJOYED COWBOYS AND ALIENS
AND IM GONNA GIVE IT AN EIGHT OUT OF TEN
IT WAS REALLY FUN
A VERY GOOD TIME
AND I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK IT OUT IN THEATERS
ANYHOW IT WAS REALLY GOOD
THAY DID THEY DIDNT REALLY DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF BACKGROUND INFO ON WHY SHE HAS TO FIGHT AND BE PREPARED
I MEAN THEY DID A LITTLE BIT OF IT
BUT NOT A WHOLE BUNCH
AND THEY SHOULDVE I GUESS
THEY SHOULDVE LIVE UP WITH MORE
AND XXX BUT BESIDES THAT IT WAS ALL OVER PRETTY GOOD
AND THERE IS LIKE SOMEONE WHILE SOMEONE THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTION
OH MY GOD A LOT OF ACTION
THERE IS SAD PART
A LOT OF SAD PARTS
BUT IT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
AND ITS A REALLY FUNNY
PROBABLY ONE OF THE BALLSIEST PROBABLY ONE OF THE BALLSIEST FIMS OD SUNDANCE 0000
UM AS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FILM IS ITS BIG
ITS BOLD
ITS STRONG
IT MAKES BIG POWERFULS STATEMENTS
IT DOESNT HOLD BACK
EVERYTHING FROM THE WAY ITS BEING RELEASED TO THE PERFORMANCES AND TO THE STORY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY OVRT THE TOP IMPRESSIVE
AND REALLY WELL DONE
ITS A HUGE BREAK THROUGH FOR KEVIN SMITH
ITS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WEVE EVER SEEN HIM DO BEFORE
JOHN GOODMAN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
MELISSA LEO WILL HAVE YOU CREEPED OUT TO YOUR INNER CORE WITH HER TINY LITTLE SMILE
ITS SO WELL DONE
FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HATING ON IT I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT
ITS A HORROR FILM IA A TRUE SENSE
AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING
UM IT IS IT IS DEFINATELY ONE OF THOSE FILMS THATS NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR YOU TO FIND
ITS BEING RELEASED IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY
WHENEVER IT COMES TO YOUR TOWN DO NOT MISS IT
ITS EXTREMLY WELL MADE
ITS EXTREMLY DARE I SAY FUN TO WATCH IN A REALLY MESSED UP KIND OF WAY
ITS EXTREMLY DARE I SAY FUN TO WATCH IN A REALLY MESSED UP KIND OF WAY AND EVEN NOW ITS A HORROR FILM
ITS DEFINATELY GOT SOME FUN KEVIN SMITH MOMENTS IN IT FOR YOU TO LAUGH WITH UM
YEAP ABSOLUTELY NOT TO BE MISSED
AND SO I WAS KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE MAYBE IF THAT WAS WHAT DISNEY WAS GOING FOR AND IT DEFINATELY WAS WHAT THAY WERE GOING FOR
BUT I BET IF YOU PUT THEM NEXT TO THE NEW FILM THAT THE STYLE WOULD BE SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO REALLY TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
UM ITS ITS GREAT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT WAS OLD FILMS
WOULD BE GREAT FOR KIDS TOO
THE STORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE
WEVE GOT GREAT JOKES
UM FUNNY JOKES THAT THE KIDS WOULD GET
UM I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE EEYORE AND POOH THINK THAT OWL IS GETTING SICK
BECAUSE HE SAYS ISSUE AND THEY THINK HE IS SAYING AT YOU
UM THAT WAS PROBABLY PART OF THE TRAILER THAT GOT ME TO GO AND SEE THE MOVIE
BEACUSE I WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY COULD FRAME THAT
SO UM IF YOU HAVENT SEEN WINNIE THE POOH AND YOU LIKE FAMILY FILMS GO SEE IT
ITS A GREAT ONE
I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND IT
I JUST GOT FINISHED WATCHING AN EXCELLENT MOVIE CALLED MARS NEEDS MOMS
AND MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE TO BE MILO MILOS MOTHER AND GRIBBLE
I LIKED GRIBBLE BECAUSE HE HELPED MILO GET MILOS MOTHER AWAY FROM THE ALIANS
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AWESOME
AND MY FAVORITE PART IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MILO HAS TO SAVE GRIBBLE
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR AGES 0 AND UP
BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE
AND IT DEPENDS WHAT AGE YOU ARE AND HOW YOU TO HOW YOU FEEL LIKE SEE THE MOVIE
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER IS FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE DIDNT THINK THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY AT ALL
I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD AND I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY S KIND OF SCARY
AND I THINK I WHY I WOULD BE SCARED IS BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL SCARED AND KIND OF SAD IF I LOST MY OWN MOTHER
BUT IT ALL TURNS OUT GREAT IN THE END
UM GRAPHICS WERE INCREDIBLE
UM SOME REALLY GOOD ACTING
SOME REALLY SUCKY ACTING
SO THIS WAS PRETTY FUNNY
COZ PEOPLE WERE LIKE EATING POPCORN AND YOU SEE THE FIRST SHOW AND PEOPLE YOU HEAR LIKE THIS THIS RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHISPERING OH MY GOD IS THAT A IS THAT AM I LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT WHAT
I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY
UM THERE COULDVE BEEN LESS BLUE NUDITY
BECAUSE WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS THE FACT THAT IN PART OF THE MOVIE HES WEARING LIKE A BLUE UM OVERALL FLONG THING MEDAL FLONG THING SO I WAS LIKE WHY NOT WEAR THE WHOLE WHOLE TIME YOU KNOW WHY WHY YOU GOT TO GO COMMAND ON US
IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH
HES FUNNY
ITS KIND OF WEIRD
I DONT KNOW CLASSIC SUPERHERO KIND OF GETTING ON KIND OF THING
ALL RIGHT SO ENOUGH OF THE NUDITY
UM BUT WHAT SUCKED WHAT WAS BAD WAS MALIN AKERMAN THE GIRL WHO PLAYS THE SILK SPECTRE II
UM JUNIOR LADY GIRL I KNOW I I MEAN SHE LOOKED FAN FANTASTIC
SHE LOOKED PHENOMENAL
SHE LOOKED LIKE A SUPERHERO
BUT SHE ACTED LIKE POWER RANGER
AND THERES A VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS
ILL TELL YOU WHO MADE THE MOVIE
WHO WAS JUST KICK ASS 000 OF TIME WAS THE GUY THAT PLAYED OUR RORSCHACH
BUT ANYWAYS HE WAS AWESOME
I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY COOL
UM HE WAS AWESOME
LIKE HE WAS INCREDIBLE
THE OTHER GUY THAT DID A REALLY GOOD JOB WAS UM JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN
HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB
VERY DARK
UM I REALLY LIKED SICKO GUY
BUT UM HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AT ACTING
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
SO OVERALL ITS ITS LIKE A BLEND OF YOUVE GOT ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
AND ITS VERY VERY INTERESTING
UM BUT ITS EXTREMELY DARK
I WARN YOU ITS A VERY VERY DARK
AND UM THERES NOT IN MY OPINION THERE WASNT VERY MUCH OF A BALANCE BETWEEN SORT OF LIKE THE GOOD EVIL KIND OF THING
AND IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SORT OF OVERWHELMINGLY BAD
UM SO AT THE END THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT OF REDEEMING VALUE THAT I THINK YOU COME UP WITH
BUT UM YOU KNOW OVERALL IT WAS GOOD
UM IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS WHY I LIKE HIM
BUT MOSTLY IM GONNA GIVE THE REASONS OF WHY I DONT THINK HES GONNA BE A CLASSIC IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FIRST MOVIE PREDATOR OR ALIENS
UM WHICH I THINK RODRIGEZ WAS GOING FOR HE TH TH HE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THE SEQUEL UM HE WANTED THIS TO BE UM TH THE PREDATOR EQUIVALENT OF ALIENS
UM AS UM YOU KNOW AS ALIENS WAS TO ALIEN
UM AND IM GONNA REALLY POINT OUT WHY THAT I DONT THINK HE REALLY PULLED HE PULLED THAT OFF
UM WHY WAS A MISTAKE REALLY TO TRY AND DO THAT
UM BUT I DID ENJOY IT
SO UM IM GONNA POINT OUT THE STUFF I DID LIKE THERE WERE SOME ACTION SCENES IN IT
THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED UM NOT ALL OF THE CHARACTERS
BUT UM I WOULD SAY THAT UM THERE WAS THERES GOOD THERE WERE FOUR GOOD CHARACTERS IN THERE
UM I I LIKED AGENT BRODYS CHARACTER
I THOUGHT HE WAS UM WELL DEVELOPED
YOU KNOW WELL DRAWN OUT CHARACTER
SOMEONE YOU CARED ABOUT
I LIKED THE GIRL WHO WAS THE ISRAELI SNIPER
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE WELL DRAWN CHARACTER
UM I LIKED THE RUSSIAN GUY JURI
UM YOU CARED YOU THERE WAS ENOUGH IN THERE FOR YOU TO CARE ABOUT HIM
AND XXX WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER
UM HE HAD SOME FUNNY HE HAD A FEW ONE LINES THAT WAS QUITE QUITE FUNNY
YEAH ONCE UNFORTUNATELY UM I THINK IN THE WRITING SOMEWHERE THEY THEY JUST WERENT UM DEVELOPED ENOUGH FEAR TO CARE ABOUT THEM UM AND THAT INCLUDES IS IT TOPHER GRACES I THINK I THINK HIS NAME WAS INCLUDS HIS CHARACTER UM
UM I JUST DIDNT THINK IT WAS WELL DEVELOPED ENOUGH AND UM I ALSO I I INCLUDE IN THAT LAURENCE FISHBURNES CHARACTER AS WELL
WHO I THINK RODRIGEZ WHEN HE WROTE THE MO WROTE THE MOVIE WAS GOING FOR A MARLON BRANDO APOCALIPSE NOW TYPE OF CHARACTER
BUT HE ACTUALLY FOUND UM WHEN HES SEEN COME UP IT SLOWED THE MOVIE DOWN UM AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM UM WITH PREDATOR TO PREDATORS COMPARED TO PREDATOR
PREDATOR IS REALLY WELL PACED MOVIE
AND IT PICKS UP SPEED AND NEVER LETS GO EV EVEN IN THE SAME XXX WHERE THEY THEY SLOW YOU KNOW THEY MEANT TO HAVE SOME DIALOGUE AND AND TALK ABOUT WHATS GOING ON YO YOU KNOW
IT FELT THE MOVIE SLOWED DOWN WHERES IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
WHEN WHEN THEY THEY WITH UM LAURENCE FISHBURNE CHARACTER IT DOES SLOW DOWN A GREAT DEAL
I DIDNT REALLY FEEL UM THE INCLUSION OF HIS CHARATER WAS NECESSARY
UM IT COULDVE BEEN WRITTEN OUT
WHICH IS WHERE ALL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD START
AND JUST ITS VERY ITS VERY CHAOTIC AT THE END OF THIS MOVIE
I LITERALLY SAID OUT LOUD WHAT QUE WHAT IS THIS MOVIE THAT I AM SEEING WHAT IS THIS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
BUT THERES A REASON FOR THAT THERES A REASON FOR WHY I WAS CONFUSED
FIRST OFF THE COMMERCIAL MAKES THE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MISTAKE OF SAYING THAT IT IS MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN INCEPTION
THANKS A LOT COMMERCIAL
THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS CONSTANTLY COMPARING IT TO INCEPTION
BUT I MUST SAY THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY BIG SHOES TO FILL SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAS A CHANCE
I I SHOULD GIVE IT A SHOT YOU KNOW
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT TO COME OUT JUST JUMP OUT ANY TIME AND SAY ITS A PARADOX
NOW THE ONLY SUSPENSFUL PART THAT I FOUND IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN MATT DAMON FIRST DISCOVERS THE BUREAU IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHICH KIND OF JUST RUINS THE SUSPENSE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IF YOUVE GOT SOME CONVENIENT GUY IN A FEDORA TO JUST TELL YOU OH YES WE ARE THE ADJUSTEMENT BUREAU AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO YOU KNOW ITS JUST KIND OF RUINS THE SUSPENSE
AND NOW IM NOT IM NOT EXCITED ANYMORE
INTERESTINGLY IT TURNED OUT TO BE MORE OF A ROMANTIC COMEDY THAN IT WAS A THRILLER
UM YOU KNOW IT HAD SOME INTERESTING WRITING
YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS FUNNY AT TIMES
MATT DAMON IS A YOU KNOW HES A PRETTY FUNNY GUY
BUT JUST ASIDE FROM THAT THEY REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THE SUSPENSFUL PARTS
OVERALL OVERALL IT HAD FAR TOO MANY PLOT HOLES
AND JUST NOT ENOUGH DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING
I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS THE CHARACTER THOMPSON
BUT HES JUST THE CREEPIEST OLD GUY YOULL EVER SEE IN YOUR LIFE HE STANDS OVER PEOPLE WHEN THEYRE ASLEEP JUST STARING AT THEM
AND UM I HAVE TO ADMIT I WAS WATCHING THIS I PURPOSLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE STUPID THAT I COULD FALL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF AND NOT MISS TOO MUCH
JUST WANTED SOMETHING TO WATCH WHILE I WAS FALLING ASLEEP
SO I DIDNT DIDNT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE
AND I UM PRETTY MUCH IT PRETTY MUCH MET MY LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MOST PART
BECAUSE I THREE MAJOR COMPLAINTS I HAVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE
UM BIGGEST ONE IS THE CGI EFFECTS WERE JUST TERRIBLE
AND UM THE STORY WAS PRETTY WEIRD
UM AND AGAIN I I IF I HAD TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION I MIGHT HAVE FOLLOWED IT MORE
AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE SENSE
UM UM THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE UM BY HALF WAY THROUGH I WAS CHECKING THE TIME AND SAW THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TWO HOURS LONG
WHICH I MEAN FOR A MOVIE ABOUT JI JOE NINTY MINUTES IS ENOUGH
OK I DONT NEED A THREE HOUR MINI XXX ABOUT JI JOE
BUT THATS JUST ME
I THOUGHT THAT TWO HOURS WAS WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MOVIE
AND THE LAST BIG THING WAS UM JUST THE THE IT IT I KNOW ITS ABOUT JIJOE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ITS GONNA BE ABOUT THE ARMY BUT IT JUST FELT LIKE UM LIKE UM MILITARY PROPAGANDA KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW
IT FELL LIKE I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE ARMY OF ONE COMMERCIALS SOMETIMES
OF COURSE ITS TOO MUCH
OF COURSE ITS GONNA BE MAKING THEM LOOK GOOD JUST FINE
I I GUESS UM BUT THE FUNNY THING IS UM I MEAN FUNNY THING IS DESPITE AS DESPITE EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT THIS MOVIE I ENDED UP HALF WAY LIKING IT
AND THATS BECAUSE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE I REALIZED THAT THIS IS JUST ITS REALLY JUST A CARTOON
IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE YOU YOURE GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CARTOON WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH MOSTLY IS WITH ALL THE CGI FX
AND AND THERE IS A LOT OF IT
I MEAN THIS MOVIE MAKES UM MAKES UM STAR WARS PRETTY CLOSE
I MEAN ITS ITS ABOUT THAT LEVEL STAR WAR IS
PRETTY CLOSE AS FAR AS JUST CGI HEAVY LIKE THIS TIME ITS WHAT ITS LIKE HUMAN FACE AND EVERYTHING AROUND THAT FACE IS CARTOON CGI COMPUTER EFFECTS
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WOULD APPEAL MORE TO YOUNGER AUDIENCE
BUT I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE MOVIE AND LAUGHING
I THINK THE MOVIE REALLY DEPICTED THE LIVELINESS OF NEW YORK CITY WHILE SINCE IM A NEW YORKER MYSELF
I ALSO LIKED HOW THE STORYLINE OF THE MOVIE WORKED TOGETHER SMOOTHLY
THE MOVIE ALSO DELIVERS MANY MEANINGFUL MESSAGES
I ALSO THOUGHT SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE FUNNY FOR EXAMPLE UM GARGAMELS CAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
THEYRE SO HILARIOUS AND SIMILAR TO XXX PERSON WITH THAT
I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO CHILDREN SIX AND UP
IT IS A FUN FAMILY FILM
PARENTS WILL FIND THEMSELVES LAUGHING AS THEY REMINISCE THEY CHILDHOOD
AND CHILDREN WILL LIKE THE MOVIE
SINCE THE SMURFS ARE SO ADORABLE AND THEY GO ON THRILLING ADVENTURES
THIS MOVIE IS ADORABLE
THIS MOVIE IS JUST TOO ADORABLE
THERE WERE SOME REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
THE VOICE ACTING EXCELLENT
THE VISUALS WERE GREAT
THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BEST 0D MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME COZ IT ACTUALLY USED 0D
TOY STORY HAD ELEMENTS OF IT BUT THIS MOVIE PLAYED WITH 0D AND UM DIFFERENT WAYS TO COME AT YOU OUT OF THE SCREEN
SO I LIKED THAT A LOT
THE VOICE ACTING IN THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
STEVE CARELL VOICES GRU AND RUSSELL BRAND ACTUALLY REALLY IMPRESSED ME WITH HIS OLD MAN VOICE FOR THE DOCTOR
OF I COULDNT I COULDNT EVEN BELIEVE IT WAS RUSSELL BRAND
I KEPT I WAS LISTENING BORED
AND THERE WAS MAYBE ONE TIME WHEN I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY HEARD RUSSELL BRAND HIMSELF
BUT OTHERWISE I THOUGHT HE WAS EXCELLENT
AS FOR 0D I SAY YES
THERES ONE SCENE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MAKES 0D ENTIRELY WORTH IT
AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THERES A LOT OF CHEAP TRICKS
BUT THERES A ROLLER COASTER SCENE AND IF YOU ARE UM GET A LITTLE BIT MOTION SICK YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA SEE IT IN 0D BECAUSE YOULL FEEL LIKE YOURE ON THIS COASTER
I MEAN MY STOMACH WAS ALMOST GOING WOHU AS WE WENT DOWN THE BIG DROP
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL
THAT WAS A GREAT EFFECT
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEAP CHILD HUMOUR
WHICH EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO
AND I I ALWAYS THINK THATS HILARIOUS
BUT WHAT MADE THIS MOVIE REALLY FUN WAS SOME OF THE ADULT HUMOUR JABS
OR WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL RAYAN GOSLING LEATHER SHOE AND SUIT PORN
BUT I ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE
SO THERES NOT GONNA BE ANY OF BAD SHIT
SO ANYWAY THE MOVIE WAS REALLY FUCKING AWESOME
I THINK THAT THAT THEY PERSONALLY THOUGHT THAT RACHEL WITHERS REALLY FUCKING LOVE SUITS AND RYAN GOSLING SO THEY MADE THIS MOVIE WITH ME IN MIND
NO REALLY LIKE RACHEL WHITERS NEEDS SOME FUCKING FAT MATERIAL
I WISH I WAS RYAN GOSLING
RYAN GOSLING THE BEST PART IN THE MOVIE
IM NOT GONNA FUCKING SPOIL ANYTHING FOR YOU JUST BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE RUDE
AND YOU SHOULD ALL GO OUT AND SEE IT AND YOU KNOW STUFF
BEST PART OF THE FUCKING ASS MOVIE WAS THIS ONE SCENE WHERE RYAN GOSLING WAS JUST STANDING THERE IN A FUCKING SUIT EATING PIZZA IN SLOW ASS MOTION
THAT WAS JUST LIKE HU LIKE ZOOMING IN ON HIM AND IM JUST LIKE SITTING HERE LIKE ANY MOTHER FUCKERS DROP
EMMA STONE WAS IN THIS MOVIE AS WELL AND YOU WOULDNT REALLY KNOW IT COZ SHE WAS HARDLY IN IT
AND I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT
COZ YOU KNOW APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET AKA TUMBLER BECAUSE EVERYONE ON TUMBLER IS ON CRACK THEY ALL THINK I LOOK LIKE HER OR LIKE SOUND LIKE HER OR ACT LIKE HER
I DONT KNOW I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE LIKE THAT LIKE MM MALE SOUNDING VOICE
LIKE I KIND OF SOUND LIKE I MIGHT HAVE A PENIS
AND YEAH I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE THAT LIKE AN EASY WAY
WE BOTH LIKE FLOOGED IN SHIT
AND SHE DIDNT REALLY ACT LIKE ME AT ALL
AND I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT IT
BECAUSE LIKE SHE MUSTVE BEEN AN ANIMAL AND SHE WASNT
AND I WAS THINKIN LIKE IF I CAN BE MOTHER FUCKING EMMA STONE AND CHRIS CAN BE ROYAN GOSLING AND THAT WOULD BE JUST GREAT DIDNT REALLY HAPPEN IN THE MOVIE
I WAS KIND OF UPSET ABOUT THAT
THERES A GIANT ASS TWIST TO THIS MOVIE AT THE END
LIKE ITS OBVIOSLY NOT LIKE A SERIOUS FUCKING MOVIE OR ANYTHING
ITS COMEDY ROMANTIC ROMCOM RAOA
IM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF FOR NOT REALISING THE TWIST BEFORE IT ACTUALLY TWISTED
BECAUSE LIKE WHAT THE FUCK LIKE THATS WHAT IM GOOD AT
IM GONNA SPOIL SKINS RIGHT NOW I TOTALLY KNEW MANNY AND RICK WERE GONNA BE RELATED I FUCKING KNEW IT LIKE I KNEW IT
I KNEW THAT INCEPTION THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE DREAMING
BUT IT WAS A REALY GOOD MOVIE
REALLY GOOD SOUNDTRACK
WATCH THIS FUCKING MOVIE
AND UM PARTICULARLY THE MOVIES THAT I FEEL LIKE SHOULDVE GOTTEN NOMINATED BUT DIDNT AND NEVER LET ME GO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE MOVIES
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SPLIT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
THERES A CERTAIN DEADPAN NATURE TO IT
IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW MOVIE FOR THE MOST PART
AND IT WAS IT WAS THOUGHFUL
BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERERE CRITICS OF MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES TOO THOUGHFUL IN A WAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD NEVER LET ME GO
A LOT OF CRITICS SAID THAT IT RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE AUDIENCE TO UM EXPLORE THE THEMES IN THE FILM AND YOU KNOW TIGHTLY SO I GUESS WHICH
UM IN A WAY A LOT OF THE THEMES IN NEVER LET ME GO WHICH WERE VERY PROFOUND AND DEEP
THEY WERENT FULLY EXPLORED
AND I THINK THAT THE MOVIE DID RELY ON YOU TO KIND OF FIGURE IT OUT AND KIND OF DEAL WITH THOSE IDEAS BY YOURSELF
BUT REGARDLESS I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
THOSE THREE ARE SOME OF THE BEST YOUNG ACTORS OF TODAY
SHE AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES SHE HAS SO MUCH GRACE TO IT AND SO MUCH FLUIDITY
AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY I MEAN EVERYBODY KNOWS HER FROM THE PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN
BUT I MEAN IN HER OTHER WORKS LIKE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE SHES JUST BEEN REALY FANTASTIC
AND ANDREW GARFIELD OF COURSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM FORM THE SOCIAL NETWORK
SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING
BUT ANYWAYS THEY DID UM THEY DID ACT VERY WELL
AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
I THINK IT TAKES PLACE SOMETIME UM ITS I DONT THINK ITS PRESENT DAY
BUT ITS UM ITS SOMEONE MODERN I WOULD SAY
ITS NOT ITS NOT LIKE A PERIOD PIECE OR ANYTHING
AND YOU DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHATS GOING ON
AND I THINK EARLY ON THE TWIST IS REVEALED
UM SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT I LIKED ABOUT THE MOVIE BETTER THAN I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK AND VICE VERSE
IT WASNT LIKE IT WASNT LIKE OH THE BOOK WAS SO MUCH HARDER THAN MOVIE
MAYBE BECAUSE NUMBER FOUR WAS NOT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK
IT WAS A GOOD BOOK
BUT BUT UM I WASNT CRAZY ABOUT IT
SO YEAH AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION
SO I LIKED THE MOVIE
BECAUSE IT DID A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BACK STORY IN THE BOOK
GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THING WITH LORAIN THE MOGADORIANS
THE NUMBERS THEY AND THEY KIND OF STUCK TO THE BOOK OF IT SO I LIKE THAT
AND BUT XXX WERE TOO HOLLYWOOD FOR ME
LIKE TH THIS THING ISNT REALLY A BIG DEAL BUT UM I I DDINT LIKE THE FACT THAT JOHN HAD AN IPHONE
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU IF YOUR TOP PRIORITY IS SURVIVAL THAN WHY WOULD YOU BE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
SO SINCE WERE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION IS THEY COULD BE LIKE SCRAPING BY OR THEY COULD BE TOTALLY RICH
BUT MY OPININ LIKE HE SHOULDNT HAVE AN IPHONE HE SHOULDNT CARE ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS SO THATS REALLY WHAT THE LIEUTENANT XXX
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL TOO COMMERCIAL IN THAT ASPECT
UM LIKE I SAID IT WASNT BIG DEAL
AND YOU PROBABLY DONT THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW JUST ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT THAT HURT YOU FOR SOME REASON YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
UM ANOTHER THING THAT DID BOTHER ME WERE THE KISSINGS
I CANT EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE ADEQUATLY WITHOUT DESCRIBING SOME SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE THIRD ACT OF THE MOVIE
IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT A SUCESS OF GREEN LANTERN MOVIE WOULD LEAD WARNER BROTHERS TO ADAPT THE FLASH AND WONDER WOMAN AMONG POSSIBLY OTHERS
AND PUT THEM IN A JUSTICE LEAGE MOVIE WITH THE RITUAL BATMAN AND SUPERMAN
SO NOT ONLY THAT THIS MOVIE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BURDEN OF TELLING ITS OWN SELFCONTAINED STORY AND SETTING UP ITS OWN INEVITABLE SEQUELS
IT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POTENTIALLY SETTING UP ALL THAT OTHERS STUFF
YEAH NOT GOOD
TO ALL THE GREEN LANTERN FANS OUT THERE I AM SO SORRY
I SAY THAT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST BECAUSE SOMEONE OWES YOU AN APPOLOGIE
AND WARNER BROTHERS IS NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU ONE
AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AS A MARVELL GEEK I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FAIR SHARE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE AND I CAN GENUINLY SYMPHATIZE WITH YOU
BEFORE I GET TO THE NEGATIVES OF THE MOVIE LET ME LIST OFF A FEW OF THE POSITIVES
I LOVE JEFFREY RUSH AND MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN AS THE VOICE ACTORS
THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR ROLES
THEY ARE GREAT ADDITIONS
I ALSO LOVE THE CASTING OF MARK STRONG AS SINESTRO
HES PERFECT FOR THAT ROLE
AND UM FINALLY A PARTICULAR STAND OUT SCENE FOR ME WAS THE FIGHTER JET SEQUENCE
IT WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ACTION SEEN IN THE MOVIE
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL PUT TOGETHER
AND UM I THOUGHT IT WORKED WORKED PRETTY WELL
UM AND IN FACT IN SPITE OF ALL THE NEGATIVES IM ABOUT TO MENTION I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS WORKING FOR A WHILE FOR ABOUT THE FIRST THIRD UM BUT AT THE END OF ACT ONE TWO SIGNIFICANT THINGS HAPPENED
HACTOR HUMMAND ARRIVES AND STARTS CHEWING SCENERY LIKE ITS A TWO DOLLAR STEAK
AND HOW JORDAN FLIES OFF TO THE GREEN LANTERN CORE PLANET OH AND THE MOVIE STARTS SEQUEL BAITING
THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS TOGETHER CAUSED WHAT WAS UP TO THAT POINT A NOBLE EFFORT TO START FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS
AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN WITH LISTING OFF THE NEGATIVES BUT IM GOING TO START WITH A FEW OF THE SUPERFICIAL THINGS
THE ACTING RANGES FROM MEDIOCRITY TO HAMFISTED FROM THE LIVE ACTION ACTORS
BUT I CANT REALLY BLAME THEM FOR THAT
THIS IS STAR WARS PREQUAL TERRITORY
THE ACTING IS NOT THAT BAD
BUT STILL ITS THAT KIND OF MOVIE MAKING
BROWNING IS MEDIOCRE ROLE
THERES NEVER A FEELING OF STAR QUALITY WITH HER
SHE ISNT TERRIBLE
BUT QUITE FRANKLY SHE IS IMPLAUSIBLE
LIKE THE AVERAGE HORROR FILM THE UNINVITED
AND VISUALLY STUNNING
AND I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING ON THE FILM BECAUSE I REALLY DO LOVE IT
OVERALL BROWNING IS JUST FAILS TO DELIVER
AND IS UPSTAGED BY MANY OTHER PERFORMANCES IN THE FILM
THE SUPPORTING CAST IS EITHER HIT OR MISS
THE HITS INCLUDE OSCAR ISAAK AS THE MAIN VILLAIN LIKE I SAID BLUE JENA MALONE IS THE SOFT SPOKEN ROCKET AND THE STEALING ABBY CORNISH IS SWEET PEA A TROUBLED AND RELUCTANT YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PACK
THE MISSES INCLUDE YOU KNOW VANESSA HUDGENS
WHO DOESNT HAVE ANY PRESENTS OR GREATNESS AT ALL
AND THE OTHER HORRIBLE I MEAN ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS CARLA GUGINO AS DOCTOR VERA GORSKI
WHOS ACCENT IS SO AWEFUL
AND WHOS IS RIDICULOUS
AND HER CHARACTER IS ALSO UNDEVELOPED AND WEAK
JON HAMM AND SCOTT GLENN COULD BRING YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
AND THEY COULD HAVE GREAT BACK STORIES
BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY BRING NOTHING TO THIS TABLE
AND WHICH HURTS THE FILM DRASTICALLY
BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTING CHARACTERS
AND COULD HAVE INTERESTING BACK STORIES
THE ACTING COULD BE BETTER AND IS VERY MEDIO
THERE IS SOME SORT OF GREATNESS TO SUCKER PUNCH THOUGH
FIRST THE VISUAL EFFECTS HERE ARE STELLAR
THEY ARE UNIQUE
INCREDIBLE ICANDY
AND JUST OVERALL SUPERB
AND THE ACTION IN THE MOVIE IS SO WELL USED
ITS BAD
OH GOD THIS IS BAD
IM NOT EVEN GONNA GO TO THE LOWS TO MAKE A WHOLE NIGHT VIDEO ABOUT THIS MOVIE
SO NO NOW KNOW THIS I AM NOT A FAN OF THE FINAL DESTINATION SERIES
I HATE IT
I MIGHT HAVE TO WATCH THE FIRST TWO AGAIN OR MAYBE JUST THE FIRST ONE TO STABILIZE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SERIES
BUT AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS SERIES IS GARBAGE
YOU CAN SENSE MY EXCITEMENT WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS BEING RELEASED
NOW I WONT EVEN TALK ABOUT ACTING COZ ITS JUST SO BAD
ITS A JOKE REALLY
NOW LET JUST GET INTO TWO THINGS THAT WILL POSSIBLY ATTRACT YOU TO THIS FILM THE VIOLENCE AND THE 0D
VIEWERS PLEASE RESIST FROM THESE TWO
THE VIOLENCE HERE IS PRETTY BAD
THERERE ABOUT TWO CREATIVE SCENES IN HERE UM ONE BEING IN INTESTINAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE RECTUM IN A SWIMMING POOL DRAIN AND A TIRE DECAPITATION THAT
THE TIRE DECAPITATION MIGHT NOT SOUND ALL THAT UNIQUE
BUT THE WAY ITS PULLED OFF ITS LIKE WOW THAT WAS SICK
I MEAN NOT THE SICK LIKE OH MY GOD THAT WAS AWESOME
NO SICK IN THE OH MY GOD THAT WAS CRAZY THAT KIND OF SICK
THERES MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF SAYING SICK NOWADAYS
BUT UM YEAH WOW AGH SAY THAT IN TWO SHEE TWO SCENES DEATH ISNT EVEN NEARLY UNIQUE IS A BIT HARSH
THE RACE STADIUM SCENE AND THE MALL SCENES IN THE BEGINNING AND THE END WHERE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE DIE IN THE CRAZIEST WAYS ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWING YOU SEE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY LATE NIGHT BUDDY VIEWINGS
SNAP MOST OF THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT
IT JUST REALLY HEH
BUT IF YOU LOVED THE SERIES AND YOU ALSO LIKED XXX THE FIRST MOVIE THAN YOURE STILL GONNA HAVE FUN
JUST GO IN WITH LOW EXPECTAIONS
IF YOUR PET PEES CARRIE WORE THOSE HORRENDOUS HIDEOUS HATS THEY WERE NOT CATCHING THE BALL
AND A FEW TIMES I DIDNT LIKE THE FASHION
A FEW TIMES I THOUGHT THAT WAS BUMPED WAY OVER THE TOP
AND THEY KIND OF LOOKED LIKE CLOWNS THE DESERT SCENE WAS ONE OF THEM
UM BUT YOU KNOW THE PREMISE IS OK
AND THERE ARE A FEW NICE MOMENTS
THE MOVIE IS REALLY TOO LONG
THEY SHOULDVE JUST CUT THE WEDDING IN THE BEGINNING
ITS NOT EVEN NECESSARY FOR THE PLOT
I ALSO THOUGHT THAT DESERT RIDING THE CAMELS ALL TROUP STOPPED LOOKING LIKE CLOWNS
BUT ALSO NOT NECESSARY
BUT I LOVE THE MOMENT WITH CHARLOTTE IN THE CLOSET BECAUSE WHO HASNT EXPERIENCED THAT
AND UM IT WAS JUST FUN TO SEE YOUR OLD FRIENDS AGAIN
SO IF YOUR A FAN ID DO IT
BUT DONT EXPECT MUCH
THE WRITING ISNT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
THE STORYLINE ISNT THIS GOOD
BUT IF YOU DONT EXPECT A LOT I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
UM I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE BUT HE WASNT
HE WAS THE SAME OLD GOOFY SETH ROGAN THAT WE ALL KNOW
UM BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD FILM
UM I THINK THAT I MEAN I HAD FUN WITH IT
SO TO ME THATS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
AND UM BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS EXPECTING SETH ROGAN TO MAYBE TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS BUT HE WASNT
BUT YOU KNOW THATS OK I GUESS
UM I STILL HAD FUN WITH IT
UM THE CAR THE BLACK BEAUTY THAT WAS AMAZING ALL THE GUNS EVEN THE CAR OVER THERE THAT WAS REALLY SWEET
AND ALL THE ACTION SCENES WERE GREAT
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT AND THE GUY WHO PLAYED KATO WHOSE FIRST NAME IS J
UM HE WAS GOOD
HE PLAYED KATO PERFECTLY
AND HE DID A GREAT JOB
UM THE ACTING WAS WAS PRETTY GOOD
AND THE ACTION WAS GOOD
UM I WOULD DEFINATELLY RECOMMEND YOU GO SEE IT IN THEATERS
COZ TAKE A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME
YOULL HAVE FUN
AND YOULL LAUGH
IT IS FUNNY ITS A FUNNY MOVIE
LOTS OF LOTS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENT I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
BUT UM YEAH GO CHECK IT OUT
ITS ONE ITS ONE TO CHECK OUT IN THEATERS I WOULD SAY
UM SNIF BUT YEAH SO THE GREEN HORNET IT WAS OK
I EXPECTED A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSNESS
BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD
IT GET IT GETS PRETTY SERIOUS
AND UM FUN AT THE END
TOO PRETTY INTENSE AT THE END
IM A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST TRON
UM I THOUGHT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO HAVE A TRON SEQUEL
BECAUSE UM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 0000S PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT COMPUTERS CAN DO EVERY EVERY ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING AND NOW TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
BECAUSE IT KINDA CONTROLS OUR LIVES SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME FOR A TRON SEQUEL
UNFORTUNATELY UM THE WRITERS AND I WERE NOT EXACTLY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH
LIP SMACKING BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FIRST THIRD OF THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING
ITS THE BEST SUMMER MOVIE IVE SEEN ALL YEAR
BUT YOU KNOW THE PACING IS SO GOOD
IT GETS STRAIGHT INTO THE STORY
YOU HAVE LOTS OF UH REFERENCES TO THE FIRST MOVIE
YOU HAVE NEW CHARACTERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE OLD ONES
AND ONCE SAM FLYNN ENTERS THE GRID YOU KNOW THE SOUNDTRACK DRAWS YOU IN
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS LOOK AMAZING
UH THEY DONT WASTE A LOT OF TIME ON EXPOSITION
BECAUSE THE MINUTE THE SOUNDPLANE ENTERS THE GRID HE IS PUT IN THE GAMES
AND LET ME TELL YOU THE GAMES LOOK GREAT
ALL THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES IN INVOLVING THE GAMES WERE GREAT TO WATCH
UM THE CHO THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE FIGHTS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE BACK IN THE GRID THAT I WASNT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STORY OR WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING
BUT THEN SAM FLYNN MEETS HIS FATHER AND TRON BASICALLY TURNS INTO A STAR WARS PREQUEL AFTER THAT ONE
DISCONNECTION THEN THAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT
THE WRITERS JUST PULL THIS OUT OF THEIR ASS
AND THE WHOLE MOVIE BECOMES ABOUT THESE CRAZY I I ISOS
AND ITS JUST LIKE OR WHY DO WE NEED THESE THINGS
IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE
BECAUSE WHEN THE OLD FLYNN FINDS THESE THINGS WHATEVER THEY ARE THEYRE SO WISE AND NAIVE KINDA LIKE NAVI NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
CLUE WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT HE CREATED IN THE FIRST MOVIE KINDA PULLS A BUNNY IN THE BOILER MOMENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE TURNS INTO A CRAZY JEALOUS PSYCHO STALKER BITCH
AND CLUE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IDIOTIC VILLAINS EVER CAUSE WHAT IS A WHAT IS CLUE
FOR SOME KIND OF FREAKY TELEPORTATION
AND ITS LIKE YOURE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OKAY IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD USING REAL PEOPLE ITS THE WORST WAY YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO THAT INFILTRATE SOME COMPUTER SYSTEM SOMEWHERE AND DETONATE SOME NUKES OR SOMETHING
AND I WAS UNBELIEVABLY SHOCKED HOW MUCH I LOVED IT
IT WAS FULL OF ACTION
GREAT DIALOGUE
THE CHARACTERS WERE SO GREAT AND WELL DEVELOPED
ITS REALLY JUST A HEART WARMING STORY
ITS A GREAT MOVIE TO SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOUR WHOLE FAMILY CAN SEE IT
ITS NOT THAT VIOLENT
XXX IT IS A TEENYTINY BIT VIOLENT AND NOT ENOUGH SO YOU CAN BRING YOUR 0 YEAR OLD
I REALLY REALY FELT FOR THE DAD IN THE EXPENDABLES
BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING OVER HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THEY WENT MISSING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE A BEND OF OUTSIDERS AND THAY HAVE ALL THOSE POWERS
THE DAD WAS JUST REALLY PROTECTIVE
AND HE MADE SURE THAT HES WHOLE FAMILY WAS SAFE
VERY HEART WARMING
VERY TOUCHING
BRAD BIRD IS A GREAT WRITER AND DIRECTOR
UM I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE WAS WHEN YOU FIND OUT AT THE END THAT THE LITTLE BABY HAD POWERS
IT WAS SO CUTE
JUST THE GREAT GREAT MOVIE
I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU ALL SEE THE EXPENDABLES
MY BOYFRIEND GOT REALLY EXCITED WHEN I TOLD HIM WE WERE GONNA GO SEE THE EXPANDABLES
AND THAN UM WHEN I WENT TO BLOCKBUSTER AND I PICKED IT UP AND I BROUGHT IT BACK HOME HE GOT REALLY DISAPPOINTED
I THINK ITS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A MOVING FILM
AND I DONT THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE HIS EMOTIONS IN THAT DEPARTMENT
SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD
SO IT WAS JUST A LITTLE AWKWARD
BUT UM WEVE OVERCOME THAT
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENDABLES EVEN THOUGH IT CAME OUT SUCH A LONG TIME AGAO
THERES BEEN A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT IT LATELY AND EVERYONES YOU KNOW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER IT
EVERYONES BEEN SAYING ITS REALLY INTENSE
I CAN SEE THAT
THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE VERY INTENSE
BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY WARM AND FUZZY MOVIEVOOVIE
SO GO SEE THE EXPENDABLES
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE IT
AND ITS REALLY WHAT YOU WOULDVE EXPACT
ITS NOT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE BY ANY MEANS
THERES LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT ALL MOVIE
AND YET THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE FOR ACTION FANS
AND REALLY THERES NO HUMONGOUS TALE TO THESE GUYS
NOT A COMPLICATED STORY
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DONT NEED A COMPLECATED FORMULA FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
THERES A BAD GUY GUY GO TAKE HIM DOWN THATS REALLY ALL YOU NEED
THIS MOVIE ESSENTIALLY WAS MADE FOR THREE REASONS IN MY OPINION
THE FIRST REASON IS THE OBVIOUS JUST TO MAKE AN EXCITING ENJOYABLE ACTION FILM
AND THATS YOU KNOW ALL THATS ALL YOU REALLY NEEDED TO DO
AND DEFINATELLY COMES THROUGH ON THAT
THE SECOND REASON THIS MOVIE WAS MADE AND IN MY OPINION THE REAL REASON IT WAS MADE AGAIN ITS SILVESTRE STALONE TELLING HIMSELF I STILL GOT IT
UM IVE GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT
HES IN TERRIFIC SHAPE FOR A MAN TWICE MY AGE WHO LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ME
THATS KIND OF MADE ME FEEL DEPRESSED
BUT HEY WHATEVER AND IS SHOWING YEAH MAYBE HES NOT WHAT HE WAS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT HE STILL HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE BILLED AS AN ACTION STAR
THERES ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH SCENES TRIPLE STAND OFF WITH SILVESTRE ARNOLD SWARZENEGER BRUCE WILLIS AND YEAH ACTUALLY IN A WAY KIND OF FELL HOLLOW
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS BASICALLY IT WAS STALONE KNOWING THESE GUYS ARENT IN THE SHAPE THEY WERE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO
AND I DONT KNOW IF THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE FEFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN THOSE GUYS WERE ABSOLUTELY PRIME IT WOULDVE BEEN JUST UM ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING MONUMENTAL MOMENT IN CINEMATIC HISTORY
BUT SEEING IT TODAY NOW WHEN IT WAS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST A ONE XXX SHIP
IT LOST A LOT OF FEELING
IT WASNT THE FINAL YOU KNOW FINALLY HAPPENED U UNITING THAT WE ALL COME TO EXPECT
IT JUST IT FELT KIND OF CUT AND DRY
WHICH WOULD START THE PLANNING THAT I WISH IT HAS HAPPENED EARLIER IN THEIR CAREERS
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS WORK ON THE FIRST ONE
I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONE WAS CREATIVE AND INVENTIVE AND REALLY BROUGHT SOMETHING NEW TO THE CINEMA
BUT THE SECOND ONE IT DIDNT IN SOME WAYS TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL
BUT IN SOME WAYS THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER
SO IT WAS JUST ABOUT EQUAL TO THE FIRST ONE
NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE
NOW UM BUT SOME OF THE BRUSH PLOT THAT YOU MEY THINK I HATED THIS MOVIE BUT YOURE WRONG ACTUALLY I DID
I REALLY LIKED IT
FIRST IM GONNA GET INTO THE ACTING WHICH WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE SECOND ONE
THE SECOND ONE HAD WOODEN ACTING IN SOME PLACES IM SORRY
I DID LIKE THE SECOND ONE
BUT THERE MOST OF THE ACTORS WE SO WITTY EXEPTION MAY BE THE POLICE COP AND KIM KIMBERLY
BUT THE REST OF THE ACTORS WERE SO WOODEN
THEY WERE JUST THEYRE JUST THEY JUST WHY ACTING WHAT THEYRE DOING ANYWAY
I DONT KNOW THEY DO SEEM THEY NEED TO LEARN ACTING BETTER
ANYWAY THE FURTHER I WENT ACTING WAS MUCH MUCH BETTER IN THE SECOND ONE
ANYWAY MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD OH MY GOD SHE IS A TERIFFIC
SHES NICE LOOKING AS WELL
BUT SHE IS ALSO A TERIFFIC ACTRESS
OLSO THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IVE EVER SEEN OUT OF HERS
IVE NOT SEEN ONE BAD MOVIE THAT SHES BEEN INTO
TERIFFIC IN THAT
BUT MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD I MUST SAY SHE IS A TERIFFIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED ACRESS
SHE DISPLAYS THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OF HER CHARACTER SO WELL
YOU ACTUALLY FEEL FOR HER CHARACTER
YOU KNOW SHES GOING THROUGH THE STRESS AND YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND YOU WANNA HELP HER
COWBOYS AND ALIENS METAPHORICALY SPEAKING IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE NFL TEAMS THAT HAS THE TALENT TO BE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION BUT INSTEAD ENDS UP BEING A WILD CART TEAM THAT JUST GETS DISMISSED IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLAYOFFS
YEAH JOB PRETTY WELL DONE
I MEAN IT WASNT A BAD YEAR
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEFT ON THE TABLE
AND THAT DESCRIBES COWBOYS AND ALIENS PRETTY WELL
THOUGH I GUESS I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TURNED OUT AS GOOD AS IT DID
BECAUSE GIVEN ALL THE STRIKES THAT IT HAD GOING AGAINST BEFORE WONDER PRODUCTION IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE
FORTUNALLY SOME GOOD DECISIONS WERE MADE BEFORE THE CAMARA STARTED ROLLING
BUT THIS PROBABLY HAD THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT OF RAISING BAD EXPECTATIONS TO UNREASONABLE LEVELS
WHEN I SAW THE FIRST TRAILER BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY SHOT UP NEAR THE TOP OF MY LIST OF MUST SEE MOVIES FOR 0000
THE FINAL PRODUCT ULTIMATELY DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HIGH ORDER OF THAT FIRST TRAILER
BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY ENJOYABLE RIDE IF YOU GO IN WANTING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COWBOYS BATTLE A BUNCH OF ALIENS YEAH YOULL PRETTY MUCH GET YOUR FILL
BUT IF THATS ALL YOURE LOOKING FOR YOULL ACTUALLY MISS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
JON FAVREAU IS PROBABLY NOT THE GUY THAT I WOULD HIRE IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR FOR AN ACTION MOVIE
I MEAN YEAH HES A COMPETENT ACTION DIRECTOR
HES ACTION SEQUENCES ARE CERTAINLY A LOT BETTER THAN THE INCOHERENT IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW SLOPE THAT WE SEE IN A TYPICAL MICHAEL BAY MOVIE
BUT ITS ACTION ISNT PARTICULARY MEMORABLE
AND THE ACTION WASNT THE MOST MEMORABLE THING ABOUT ANY ON THOSE MOVIES
THE IRONMAN FILMS ARE FONDLY REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR ROBERT DOWENY JR NOT THE ACTION
AND THE SAME THING HAS MORE OR LESS HAPPENED HERE YEAH THATS RIGHT
THE MOVIE CALLED COWBOYS AND ALIENS DANIEL CRAIG STEELS THE WHOLE DAMN SHOW
HES PLAYING A VARIATION OF THE ICONIC MAN WITH NO NAME CHARACTER THAT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY CLINT EASTWOOD
AND NOW THAT IVE SEEN HIM IN THE ROLE I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER CURRENT ACTOR TRYING OT PULL IT OFF
HE IS PERFECT FROM START TO FINSIH
HARISSON FORD IS A LONG FOR THE RIDE AND HAVING A BLAST AS THE SECOND LEAD
AND THE CAST IS PRETTY WELL ROUNDED OUT WITH SUPPORDTING PERFORMANCE FROM GUYS LIKE SAM ROCKWELL AS THE DOC
THEYRE ALL PLAYING CLICHED STOCK WESTERN CHARACTERS
BUT I REALLY DONT CARE THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE WALKING CLICHES WHEN THEY ARE THIS WELL DONE
AND THE ACTORS DO SUCH A GOOD JOB OF CARRYING OF THEIR PARTICULAR ARCS
COWBOYS AND ALIENS PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY
SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE GOT WRITING CREDIT FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE RESULTS ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
AND I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD BECAUSE MATT DAMON WAS IN IT
AND I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED
LIKE THEY TALK FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES AND INSTANTLY KISS WHICH IS DUMB
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THE CONCEPT WAS COOL
BUT THEY DID NOT EXECUTE IT VERY WELL
AND THEY LEFT A LOT OF PLOT HOLES
THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR THESE REASONS
NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE LOVE IS FORCED
YOU DONT FEEL THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
AND IT IS VERY RUSHED
I MEAN YOU DONT SEE WHY THESE TWO PEOPLE LOVE EACH OTHER
THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT REALLY WITH THESE TWO
LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT NONE WHERE THESE TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER
THERES NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER
YOU DONT SEE WHY THEY SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER CAUSE THEY DONT SHOW IT IN THE MOVIE
OH MY GOSH BAD MOVIE
REALLY BAD MOVIE
I WISH I WERENT
BECAUSE I TRULY LOVE AN ACTION FLICK ACTION COMEDY FLICK EVEN BETTER RIGHT
BUT BASICALLY SETH ROGAN BROUGHT NONE OF THE CHARM THAT HE NORMALLY DOES TO HIS ROLES
IN FACT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTERS IVE SEEN A LONG TIME
YEAP A HORRIBLE PROTAGONIST
HE UM HAD ALL THE CHARM OF A NARCISSIST XXX BOY THE WHOLE FILM
AND UNLIKE OTHER FILMS FOR THEY KIND OF A NARCISSTIC XXX BOY BUT THEY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE YOU KNOW
THERES SOMETHING THAT JUST KIND OF MAKES THAM SO SL SLIGHTLY ENDEARING EVEN THOUGH THEYRE KIND OF THE JACK ASS YOU KNOW
YOURE LIKE OH THEYRE STILL KIND OF COOL
NO NO HES UNFUNNY NOT FUNNY AT ALL
UM HES JUST A JACK ASS
UM KATO KICKS ASS HANDSOME GUY
BORING
HES BORING
JUST LIKE LOOK AWAY WHAT HE CAN DO HE CAN DO LOTS OF STUFF
WHAT WA WHAT HES WHAT W WHY YOU HAVE NO SKILLS WHATSOEVER
YOU CANT EVEN TELL FUNNY JOKES
AND THAN CAMERON DIAZ WHOS SUPPOSED TO BE PLUCKY I GUESS BUT SHES JUST KINF OF USELESS
HI IM PRETTY I HAVE A GIANT SMILE IM SUPPOSED TO KNOW THINGSUM WALK OF SCREEN
UM YEAH THE CHARACTERS DIDNT CARE WEATHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
KATO WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS ANY GOOD WHATSOEVER
AND HE WAS STILL BORING
UM YEAH THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OK
NOTHING THATS WORTH GOING TO THEATERS TO SEE
AND YEAH I THINK THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED THEIR MOTIVATION BIHIND ANYTHING THEY DID WAS THE VILLAIN
HE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT WAS SLIGHTLY INTERESTING
WHO SEEMED TO HAVE GENUINE AFFECTION FOR OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
AND IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING
I MEAN THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT SHOWS GENUINE CARE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BE THE VILLAIN
HMM YEAH SKIP IT
DONT SEE IT
BECAUSE IM STILL EXCITED ABOUT IT
AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE I WAS EXTREMLY EXCITED ABOUT SAW 0
OK ALL OF YOU KNEW THAT OBVIOUSLY
SO I WAS YOU KNOW REALLY HYPED UP
AND EXCITED TO SEE IT
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WAS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN THE SAW 0
NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
BUT IT WAS STILL REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD
AND UM ITS JUST MADE ME REALLY REALLY EXCIDED FOR SAW 0
ONE OF THEM WAS GREAT
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL
THE GREAT PLOT WAS WITH HOFFMAN TYING UP ALL LOOSE ENDS AND STUFF
AND THE IRRELEVANT PLOT WAS WITH FIVE RENDOM STRANGERS
KIND OF LIKE IN SAW 0
BUT I TOTALLY MISSED HOW IT TIED IT TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
AND IM PRETTY SURE THATS BECAUSE IT DIDNT TIE IN TO THE MOVIE AT ALL
SO THAT WAS REALLY BIZZARE AND I DIDNT CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AT ALL
BECAUSE THEY WERENT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED WELL REALLY
SO IT WAS JUST REALLY REALLY STRANGE
BUT LUCKILY HOFFMANS STORY UM WAS A REALLY REALLY REALLY AWESOME
AND UM IT TOTALLY MADE UP FOR THAT SO THATS OK
AND I GUESS THATS SORT OF TRUE
BECAUSE I SURE DIDNT SEE THE END COMING
BUT THE END WAS REALLY YOU YOU KNOW
BUT I THOUGHT THE BEST PART OF SAW 0 WAS THE STORYLINE LIKE IN GENERAL
THE ENDING WAS NOT YOU KNOW CRAZY SHOCKING OR ANYTHING LIKE USUAL
IT WAS NOT A REAL HUGE SAW TWIST MOMENT
UM SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS A LITTLE SURPRISING I GUESS
THATS NOT TO SAY THAT THE ENDING WASNT GOOD BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS
BUT IT WAS NOT EXECTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING AND SE SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE END WAS BETTER THAN THE ENDING
WHICH IS STILL GOOD
BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS GOOD
SAW 0 HAS LEFT LIKE NO CLOSURE AT ALL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
AND IT PRETTY MUCH JUST LEFT THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR SAW 0
BUT MAN OH MAN IT REALLY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
AND IT DIDNT EVEN YOU KNOW TRY TO CLOSE IT AT ALL LIKE THE WIND ISNT GONNA BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING ITS JUST OPEN
BUT LIKE I SAID THE PLOT OF HOFFMAN AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS REALLY REALLY AWESOME
AND IT FIT VERY WELL INTO THE SAW SERIES IN MY OPINION
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WRITERS FOR THAT
BUT ILL SMACK THEM IN THE FACE FOR THE OTHER IRRELEVANT PLOTLINE
AND DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE THINKING
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH JUST AND EXCUSE TO PUT TRAPS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT
LIKE I SAID I LOVED THE HOFFMANS STORYLINE
SO YOU KNOW I GUESS IT BALANCES OUT
AND IT IS JUMPY FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE GETTING SCARED OR JUMPY OR ANYTHING
BUT FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO LOVES HORROR MOVIES
AND LIKE I DO JUMP
BUT I DONT EXACTLY GET SCARED
SO I THINK IM LIKE IMMUNE TO THEM
AND THE ONLY HE MO FILM THAT IM REALLY SCARED ABOUT IS SMALL SOLDIERS
I JUST THATS FREAKY AS HELL YEHA
BUT INSIDIOUS UM STAR REALLY GOOD
LIKE IT CRACKED ON STREIGHT AWAY WITH WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
LIKE IT DOSNT JUST LIKE AND I WAS AT UM THERES A PROBLEM THERES A STORY LIKE ADN ITS LIKE STREIGHT AWAY FUN STORYLINE STARTED
AND SOME OF THE ACTING IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH MY GOD YOU WOULDNT REALLY DO THAT
BUT THATS LIKE OLD MOVIES ITS JUST LIKE I WOULDNT SAY BAD CASTING
BUT ITS JUST SOMETIMES ITS JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE OH GOD THEY REALY SHOULDNT HAVE DONE THAT CRINGE
UM BUT REALLY GOOD
LIKE REALLY JUMPED ME MY FRIEND
AND SHE WANTED TO GO HOME AND THATS LIKE SEEING A LOT FOR HER COZ SHE LIKES HORROR MOVIES AS MUCH AS I DO
BUT IT REALLY SURPRISED AS I SAID WHAT YOU WANNA GO HOME
HUH BUT I AM IT WAS JUMPY
I JUMPED HELL OF A LOT TIMES
AND I WOULD GO TO THE CINEMA AGAIN TO SEE IT
BECAUSE THAT ATMOSPHERE LIKE EVERYONE JUST SCREEAMS
AND JUST AND ITS JUST ITS SO FUNNY
UM SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I DO LIKE IF I JUMP A LOT
HAH SO EVERYONE LIKE EVERYONE IN CINEMA WAS KIND LIKE ME
BECAUSE EVERYTIME THAT WAS LIKE A JUMP EVERYONE JUMPED
YOU COULD FEEL THE JUMP IN
AND EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING AFTERWARDS
I THINK THATS HOW THEY COPE WITH GETTING JUM LIKE SCARED AND JUMP AND STUFF
FROM THERE IT DOES GET A BIT LIKE HUH NOT AS REAL AS WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON
ITS KIND OF LIKE QUITE FAKE LIKE I JUST I COULDNT BELIEVE IT I WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BECAUSE THERE IS PEOPLE THAT WANNA GO AND SEE IT HAVENT SEEN IT YET AND MIGHT SEE THIS VIDEO
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MOVIE THEATERS TO GO SEE A MOVIE IVE BEEN WAITING PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS FOR
IF YOU ARE AS BIG A FAN OF DISNEY AS I AM
YOU KNOW OF COURSE I WAS WAITHING FOR THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG
I HAD SOME HIGH EXP O MAYBE NOT HIGH EXPECTATIONS PER SE BUT I WAS DEFINATELY EXPECTING THIS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE
AND OH OH MY GOSH I WAS BLOWN AWAY
ANYWAY OH YOU CAN SEE IM STILL SPEECHLESS THIS MOVIE WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS INCREDIBLE SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT COLOR PALETTES SMOOTH HAND DRAWN ANIMATION YOU KNOW
THEY ARENT DOING SO WELL BROTHER BEAR
SO UM I GUESS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE UM COMPUTER ANIMATED FILMS FROM NOW ON
I PERSONALLY I LIKED ATLANTIS

I DIDNT REALLY LIKE BA BROTHER BEAR
AND I HATED HOME ON THE RANGE

UM LIP SMACKING SIGH HM MARVEL ONCE AGAIN DECIDED TO TOSS ANOTHER RANDOM BITCH IN THIS MOVIE WOLVERINES BITCH

AND YOU PROBABLY DID THE BEST PORTRAYAL OF SABRE TOOTH EVER
ALTHOUGH I DO AGREE THAT THE LOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO FIT THE ACTUAL SABRE TOOTHS LIKE WITH THE RIGHT HAIR
UM WE I LOVE THE SCENE WHERE SABRE TOOTH THROWS WOLVERINE INTO THE TRUCK THAT FEEL GOOD JACKOFF
UM FRED DUKES IS THE BLOB
XXX SEEING RED RIDING HOOD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME

NOW COLUMBOS IS A BASICALLY UM OCD
THE UM CROSS OF PERSONALITY IS REALLY UM CHARISMATIC AND DYNAMIC
UM IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU REALLY CANT TRUST ANYONE IN THIS SITUATION
ZOMBIELAND IS A REALLY SUCESSFUL HORROR COMEDY
AS IT CONTAINS UM REA REALLY WELL DONE AND FAITHFUL HOMAGES TO THE ZOMBIE HORROR SUB GANRE
AND UM WHILE ALSO MAINTAINS ITS KIND OF DETACHED UM SATIRE OF THE GENRE
BUT ITS REALLY WELL DONE
BECAUSE UM YOU REALLY WANNA SEE IT FOR YOURSELF

THIS CREDIT SEQUENCE I THINK IS THE BEST CREDIT SEQUENCE UM SINCE WATCHMAN
AND I HONESTLY THINK IF WE HADNT HAVE SEEN WATCHMAN THIS WOULD BE THE BEST CREDIT SEQUENCE OF THE YEAR
YEAH IT REALLY IS GOOD I MEAN
IT USES UM AND THIS JUST DOESNT APPLY TO THE UM UM CREDIT SE SEQUENCE ON IT OWN BUT APPIES TO THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE IT REALLY KNOWS HOW TO USE S SLOW MOTION WITHOUT MAKING IT A GIMMICK
THE SEQUENCES OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM WHICH FEATURES COLUMBUS EXZPLAINING SOME OF HIS RULES UM TO SURVIVING A ZOMBIE APOCALIPSE ARE REALLY WELL DONE
THE XXX SEQUENCE IS REALLY WELL DONE
BUT ITS A VERY KIND OF UM STYLISTIC EDGE ON IT
IT ITS ALMOST LIKE UM IMAGINING TARANTINO DIRECTED A ZOMBIE MOVIE
AND THE STYLE OF THE FILM LIKE THE UM THE FREE STREAMS OF SLOW MOTION THE UM THE JUMP COOKS AND ALL THAT STUFF FEELS VERY KIND OF UM TARANTINO ASK
THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE
NICHOLAS CAGE SHOULD NOT DO THESE KIND OF MOVIES
HES ALWAYS IN THESE KINDS OF MOVIES ALL THIS SORCERER WITCH VOODOO KIND OF MOVIES
AND ITS GETTING REALLY TIRING
HES HORRIBLE AT IT
NO ONE TAKES HIM SERIOUSLY
W W W WHEN HES ONSCREEN I WANT TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE
HES VERY BORING
HE WA HE WAS VERY ANNOYING
HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
AND I WAS SITTING IN THE THEATRE SLEEPING
HE WAS VERY GOOD IN HELLBOY
BUT IN THIS MOVIE HE WASNT GOOD AT ALL
I I I DIDNT REALLY CARE FOR HIS CHARACTER AT ALL
HES VERY BORING AS WELL
WHOLE MOVIES VERY BORING
IT MADE NO SENSE
I DIDNT REALLY CARE ABOUT IT AT ALL
I HAD NO IDEA WHY I EVEN SAW THIS MOVIE
UH THE TRAILER LOOKED LIKE IT COULD BE A LITTLE G GOOD
BUT WHEN I SAW IT WAS JUST TOTALLY BORING
BUT IT WASNT REALLY MADE WELL
AND THIS IS THE WORST BY FAR
IT WAS VERY VERY VERY BORING
MADE NO SENSE
ACTION SCENSE WERE VERY DUMB
I HATED IT
BUT THE LAST HALF HOUR OF THE MOVIE IT FELT LIKE THEY HAD ADDED LIKE A CGI ORGASM
YOU KNOW THEY JUST TRIED UH WITH THE CGI THAT THEY PUT T T T THEY THEY THREW SO MUCH CGI AT YOU
AND IT WAS AWFUL
LIKE IT WAS LIKE SPEWING CGI LAST HALF HOUR OF THE MOVIE
LIKE EVERY SINGLE SCENE WAS CGI
IT WAS TERRIBLE
I HATED IT
I WAS SITTING THERE IN THE THEATRE LAUGHING HOW BAD THE MOVIE WAS AT SOME POINTS
UH HUH HOW ABOUT THE ACTING AND THE ACTION WAS WAS JUST SO DULL
AND BORING
DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE
SEASON OF THE WITCH WAS HORRIBLE ACTING
DULL
JUST DONT SEE THIS MOVIE
I DONT KNOW WHY I EVEN SAW IT
SO SEASON OF THE WITCH IS RATED 0 OUT OF 00
I MEAN IT STARTS OUT REALLY SLOW
BUT OVERALL UM GO SEE IT
IT WAS A COOL MOVIE
THE ACTING WAS ALLRIGHT
UM I THOUGHT THEY CASTED KIND OF WELL
BUT WHAT REALLY THREW ME OFF WAS THE DIALOGUE VERY CHEEZY DIALOGUE
OH MY GOD THE WHOLE MOVIE HAD A REALLY DRY DIALOGUE
THERE WERE A COUPLE FUNNY PARTS
BUT I DONT THINK THE HUMOUR REDEEMED THE MOVIE FROM BEING SO BAD IN THE DIALOGUE DEPARTMENT
WHOEVER WROTE THIS ISNT THE WRITER DEFINATELLY
BUT OVERALL I ENJOYED IT
THE THE WHOLE MOVIE I WAS YOU KNOW THINKING THIS ISN AS BAD AS IVE HEARD AND IT WASNT
UM AND THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY SHORT
AND THE DIALOGUE THREW ME OFF
OTHER THAN THAT UM I THINK IT WAS AND OK MOVIE
DEFINATELLY A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AVERAGE
I DONT THINK ITS AS BAD AS YOU PROBABLY READ ON REVIEWS
SO YEAH GO SEE IT
XXX WHITNESSING THE CHANGES AND GROWTH OF THE CHARACTERS ITS USAULALY A PATH OF DISCOVERY
THE LAST MINUTE TITLE THAT THEY THREW ON AT THE THEATERS
DREAMWORKS IS CONFUSING ME
THEY SOLVED THIS DILEMMA BY REMOVING THE PAST WITHIN ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE TWIST COURTECY OF NEW BETTY RUMPELSTILTSKIN
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN SHREK 0 0 AND 0 ARE WIPED AWAY
NOT A BAD IDEA FOR A SEQUEL
BUT ALSO NOT VERY ORIGINAL
SHREK 0 MISSES OUT ON THE MAGIC THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM A REAL JOY TO VIEW
GONE ARE THE WICKEDLY SATIRICAL STAND UPS OF THE WORLD OF FAIRY TALES
AND ALSO THE CUTE WINGS TO POP CULTURE
AND THEIR PLACE IS A RUN OF THE MILL ANIMATED ACTION ADVENTURE PLOT WITH A FEW CHUCKLES TROWN IN
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS AND CREATORS TOOK THE EASY WAY OUT
IF AWARD FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS OF SHREK IN HIS SUPPORTING CAST THEY ARE STILL VOICED BY THE ORIGINAL STARS MIKE MYERS EDDIE MURPHY CAMERON DIAZ AND ANTONIO BANDERAS THE FILM WOULD BE A REAL BUST
UNLESS YOUR KIDS ARE DYING TO SEE IT ID WAIT FOR THE DVD
I GIVE SHREK FOREVER AFTER DIRECTED BY MIKE MITCHELL A GRADE OF B MINUS
UM SO CHANNING TATUM AND MARLON ARE TRANSPORTING IT THEY GET AMBUSHED BY UM I THINK ITS COBRA ITS KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN IT
CUZ ITS LIKE THE DUDE THAT MADE THE TECHNOLOGIES I I CANT RUIN THE MOVIE
UM FROM THERE IT JUST GOES INTO RIDICULOUSNESS
THE THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS LIKE I I I WANNA COMPARE IT TO TRANSFORMERS 0 AND I ACTUALLY DID
I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW THEYRE BOTH HASBRO TOYS THEYRE BOTH MOVES THAT ARE COM MADE FOR CHILDREN
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF ADULT SITUATIONS IN IT
BUT THE THING ABOUT GI JOE COMPARED TO TRANSFORMERS IS TRANSFOMERS 0 DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WANTED TO DO
LIKE IN SOME PARTS YOU HAD PEOPLE GETTING KILLED AND THE NEXT PART YOU HAD FART JOKES AND STUPID FRAT HUMOR AND ALL THAT OTHER CRAP
AS FOR GI JOE WAS IT WAS JUST LIKE LAUGHING ITS THE THE PLOT THE THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE
THE PLOT IS RIDICULOUS BUT NO ONE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY
LIKE LIKE EVEN THE ACTORS WERE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW ITS A MOVIE ABOUT A FUCKING TOY
LAUGHING SO THEYRE JUST SITTING THERE
LIKE THIS ONE PART WHERE THE GIRLS LIKE MY DADDY TAUGHT ME TO WIN WIN AND THEN SHES LOOKING IN THE CAMERA AND IM LIKE WOW LIKE UM THIS ACTINGS PRETTY BAD
BUT THE THEY THEY KNEW IT WAS JUST A MOVIE ABOUT A A A A DOLL SO THEY DIDNT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY
LIKE KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
BUT THE MOVIE WAS WELL IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE
LIKE IT WAS LIKE THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE THE ACTION MADE UP FOR IT
THERE WAS PARTS THIS IVE SEEN SOME CREATIVE DEPTHS IN THIS MOVIE IVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IVE SEEN PEOPLE GET SHOT IN THE EYE YOU KNOW AND THAT WOULD BE IT BUT PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN THE EYE AND THEN THE THEY HEADS EXPLODE AND THEN SOME DUDE GET HIS TORSO CUT OPEN AND AND SOME DUDES HANGING OUT OF THE CAR HIS HEAD GOT BLOWN OFF AND FREAKING PEOPLE ARE FLYING AND JUMPING
SO YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS REVIEW
BUT TO ANY OF YOU WHO ARE I EXPECT A THUMBS UP
THEYRE BACK TO YOU HAVING TWO KILLERS THANKFULLY
BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE HAVING THE KILLER BE ABLE TO BE EVERYWHERE IF THERES TWO OF THEM
HMPH MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE RESULTS OF THIS PROCESS ARE ITS BETTER THAN SCREAM 0
AND ACTUALLY IS BETTER THAN SCREAM 0
A LOT OF PEOPLE DONT LIKE SCREAM 0
I THINK ITS HIGHLY UNDERRATED
I HATED SCREAM 0
BUT I THINK THIS ONE DID BEAT SCREAM 0
NOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE FIRST HOUR THAT MUCH THOUGH
IM SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER THE STAB MOVIES THAT WERE BASED ON THE SCREAM MOVIES OR THE EXPERIENCES OF SIDNEY IN UNIVERSE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMENT ON THE KILLERS REENACTING THE MOVIES OR FOLLOWING UP THE MOVIES WELL IN THE FIRST HOUR THOSE BECOME WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH OF A PLOT POINT BASICALLY
I THINK XXX I WANT TO SEE IT
BUT IT ACTUALLY BASICALLY MAKES THE CHARACTERS CONGITION NOT JUST OF THE GENRE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE IN BUT OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE TO A RIDICULOUS EXTENT
IM JUST KINDA LIKE NO THIS IS GOING TO FAR
WHAT WHATEVER THE NAME IS TOO LONG
ITS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
AND ITS THEY LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A GOOD CORE
BUT HM IT JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT ITS ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK FROM A POINT JUST BEFORE KATRINA HITS NEW ORLEANS
I DIDNT NEED ANY OF THAT CRAP
I DONT NEED IT ALL TOLD IN FLASHBACK
I DONT NEED THE ADDED ELEMENT OF KATRINA
IT DOSENT IT JUST ITS TOO MUCH CRAP IN HERE
THE THE MOVIES IS TOO LONG
THEY JUST NEED TO CUT THAT OUT
ANOTHER THING IS WE DONT NEED HIS ENTIRE LIFE
TH WE DO NOT NEED THE ENTIRE SPAN BIRTH TO DEATH
JUST GIVE ME A NICE INTERESTING CHOKE
AND SCALE IT DOWN ON LIKE TWO HOURS
THIS ALSO FALLS IN TO THE TRANDY IS VERY POPULAR THESE DAYS IF YOU DO A WHOLE ALL OF CGI
UM AND IF YOURE GONNA DO MOSTLY CGI JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED MOVIE
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT JUST HAS A POLYURETHANE COATING ON IT
MAKES HIM LOOK TOO TOO GOOD
BUT DONT GET ME WRONG ITS NOT ALL BAD
ITS GOT MY TWO FAVORITE ACRESSES IN IT TILDA SWINTON AND CATE BLANCHETT
LIKE I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY INTERESTING IDEA
AND THEY DID A LOT OF GOOD THINGS WITH IT
BUT ITS ITS LIKE SOMEONE MADE YOU A KICK ASS SANDWICH BUT THEY PUT MAYONNAISE ON IT AND YOU DONT LIKE MAYONNAISE AND ITS NOT LIKE TOMATO OR LETTUCE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT OFF NO ITS GOT IT MAYONNAISE IN ITS ALL OVER EVERYTHING AND NOW YOURE STUCK WITH THIS KICK ASS SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE KICK ASS IF IT DIDNT HAVE MAYONNAISE ON IT BUT IT HAS MAYONNAISE ON IT OR YOU GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH GO MAKE ANOTHER SANDWICH
THIS MOVIE IS JUST NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH
I REALLY LIKED DAVID FINCH
I LIKED ALL THE UM I LIKE THE CAST
BUT AND ITS A GOOD STORY
BUT CLAP HUH ITS A PASS
MY NEIGHBOR PROBABLY THINKS IM CRAZY YELLING ABOUT MOVIES TO A CAMERA
IT ONLY HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A FILM THAT WAS BOTH PROVKING AND ACTION PACKED
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ITS JUST AN UGLY WILD VIOLENT UNVOLVING AND SADISTIC EXERCISE
THAT I GOT VERY LITTLE JOY OUT OF
IN FACT I GOT MOSTLY PAIN OUT OF IT
THATS PRETTY HEAVILY INFERRED IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE
WHEN SHE GETS THERE IS FORCED TO NOT ONLY BE TRAPPED IN THE VOCATION THAT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESNT WANNA BE IN
NOW IT ALSO TAKES SO REALLY CREEPY XXXOF THE FACT THAT EMILY BROWNING IN THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE SHES UNDERAGE
BUT I DONT KNOW
THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE VIDEO GAME IN A CERTAIN WAY
IN FACT THE FIRST TIME SHE GOES IN IT LOOKS LIKE A JAPANESE TEMPLE
AND LATER TIME SHE GOES LIKE A WORLD WAR II BATTLEFIELD UM CASTLE THIS KIND OF PULLED OUT OF LORD OF THE RINGS
WHATS IN HER MIND WITHIN HER MIND IN A WAY ITS KIND OF LIKE INCEPTION IN THAT WAY
ITS KIND OF PLAYING WITH THE IDEA WHATS REAL WHATS NOT WHAT THE MATRIX FILMS DID
ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THE BEST COMPARISON THIS IS THIS FILM WOULD ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING LIKE PANS LABYRINTH
I WOULD PUT MONEY ON IT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE THE BLOCKBUSTER HIT OF THE SUMMER IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MOVIES
I IM A CAP GUY CAPTAIN AMERICA FAN
I THINK THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL
UM SO I THINK THOR IS REALLY GONNA DO WELL
I THINK ITS GONNA CATAPULT CHRIS HEMSWORTH TO BE EVEN A BIGGER STAR
UM GREAT 00S MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN IT
CHARLIE SHEEN WAS WINNING THERE
AND HES WINNING NO
SO THEY COULD UM UM KIND OF GET A LITTLE BIT OF CHRIS HEMSWORTH STAR POWER INTO THAT
UM GREAT MOVIE OVERALL
THEY DID VERY WELL TO ESTABLISH THE CHARACTER OF THOR
THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF COMIC BOOK SHOWS AND MOVIES
AND YOU SAW THIS WITH THE NBC RECENT FLOP OF THE CAPE WHICH IS A SHOW I LOVE
BUT THE AUDIENCE THAT WAS WATCHING IT THEY NEEDED THEY NEEDED A PAY OFF RIGHT AWAY
AND THEY NEEDED CHARACTER ESTABLISHED RIGHT AWAY
UM WHAT YOU GET IN THE SITCOMS IN TERMS OF COMIC BOOKS AND KIND OF THE MOVIES THAT TAKE SO LOUD TO BUILD THAT
AND WHY IS THIS PERSON WEARING TIGHTS
OR WHY ARE THEY CARRYING A HAMMER
YOU KNOW WHY WHAT IS THEIR MISSION
OR WHY WHY ARE THEY HERE
YOU HAVE TO ESTABLSIH THAT FAIRLY QUICKLY
AND I THINK THAT DIRECTORS OF THOR AND THE SCRIPT WRITERS DID THAT RIGHT AWAY
YOU SAW THOR FOR HOW HES IN THE COMICS POMPOUS AN AROGANT INDIVIDUAL
UM BUT THEY ALSO DID A GREAT JOB IN BUILDING THE BACKSTORY OF JANE FOSTER PLAYED BY NATALIE PORTMAN AND HER CREW AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THOR
SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
THEY DIDNT BELABORED THOR ON EARTH
HE SOUNDED LIKE HE DIDNT LEARN FROM THE EARTHLINGS
UM SO THAT MAKES SENSE
YOU GET OTHER WHOLE SHIELD INVOLVEMENT WHICH IS COOL TO SEE THAT A LOT OF COOLER REFERENCES THAT AT ONE POINT THEY REFERENCE IM A DOCTOR WITH GAMA RADIATION
UM FIRST THINGS FIRST CHRISTINA AGUILERAS XXX I SWEAR THE XXX XXX
UM WHY I SAID THAT IS BECAUSE SHE IS GOD A CRAZY CRAZY VOICE
AND SHE SURE CAN SING REALLY REALLY WELL IN THIS MOVIE YOU KNOW
AND YOU KNOW IT MAKES YOU WANNA KNOW WHO ELSE YOU KNOW IN THE HISTORY OF NOWADAYS HAS THE VOICE LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW ITS NOONE
BUT SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE SHES 00
AND HER FACE DOESNT MOVE AT ALL
COZ WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE MOVES IT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU FEEL WORRIED FOR HER
YOU FEEL LIKE HER FACE IS GOING TO FALL APART
AND OVERALL THE MOVIES QUITE ENTERTAINING
THAT THE DANCERS UM WONDERFUL
ITS SEXY BUT NOT SLUTTY
WHO IS DROP DEAD GORGEOUS BY THE WAY
UM THE SONGS IN THE MOVIE ARE WONDERFUL
YOU KNOW IT MATCHES THE WHOLE THEME OF THE MOVIE YOU KNOW CABARET AND YOU KNOW THE LOOKS
AND OVERALL PROBABLY ID GIVE IT ABOUT 00 STARS YOU KNOW POPCORN MOVIE AND YOU KNOW
CONSIDERING ALL THE AWESOME MOVIES THAT WE HAD AND XXX INCEPTION THE BLACK SWAN AND YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL NETWORK
THIS ONE YOU KNOW PROBABLY IN THE MIDDLE SO 00 STARS
AND IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO SPEND GO AHEAD
ANYWAYIT WAS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE
I DID NOT THINK I WAS GONNA LIKE IT
I REALLY DIDNT WANNA GO SEE IT
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAN WHEN PRODUCTION COMPANIES START PUSHING MOVIES THAT FAR AHEAD AND WHEN THEY WERE GONNA BE RELEASED THAT USAUALLY MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOT GONNA BE GREAT
AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THIS MOVIE
I WAS I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT
UM THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO THIS MOVIE
ITS GREAT FOR ALL AGES
UM I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS REALLY CUTE
AND AGAIN IT DOES REALLY TUG AT THE HEART STRENGHTS WITH THE LITTLE BABY ANIMALS AT THE BEGINNING
UM IT HAS IT HAS A VERY PREDICTABLE STORY
THAT SO WHAT IS STILL A REALLY GREAT MOVIE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO
BUT IF IT WAS ANNE HATHAWAY WHO DID THE SINGING SHE DID A GREAT JOB
I HAD NO IDEA THAT ANNE HATHAWAY COULD REALLY SING
ANYWAY UM I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF IF YOURE LIKE ME AND YOU DONT NORMALLY GO TO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
AND IM IM NOT REALLY IN A BIG HURRY AT MY AGE TO GO SEE ANIMATED MOVIES
UM BUT THERE REALLY HASNT BEEN MUCH TO HAS COME OUT THIS YEAR SO FAR THAT IM DYING TO GO SEE
AND WE REALLY WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE UM LAST NIGHT
AND I WAS THOROUGHLY UM SURPRISED
AT HOW MUCH I REALLY DID ENJOY IT
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
IT WAS AMAZING
THE PREMIERE ITSELF WAS REALLY COOL
AND I ACTUALLY LIKED THE FILM A LOT
AND I WASNT EXPECTING TO
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HOW THE HELL IS DICKENS AND DISNEY GONNA WORK TOGETHER LIKE THIS
BUT I THOUGHT THEY ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY WELL
AND THE END PART IS REALLY REALLY FUNNY
BECAUSE HES BEEN SUCH A GRUMPY CHARACTER AND HES REALLY SCARED AND IN THE END HES SO CHANGED AND HES REALLY FUNNY
HES LIKE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
AND ITS ALL KIND OF ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN
THE ANIMATION WAS AMAZING
I WASNT EXPECTING THAT MUCH
BECAUSE SOMETIMES 0D ISNT REALLY THAT GOOD
BUT IT WAS FENOMENAL
YOU KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS 0D
THE VOICES ARE REALLY GOOD
THAT WAS ONE OF MY OTHER CONCERNS
WAS THAT AS AN ENGLISH PERSON I GET REALLY ANNOYED WHEN AMERICAN SHOWS AND FILMS HAVE AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
BUT THAN ITS SO OBVIOUSLY NOT AN ENGLISH CHARACTER
BUT YEAH GENERALLY THE ACCENTS WERE REALLY REALLY GOOD
SO GOOD ONE YOU AMERICA FOR DOING THAT
I DOUBT THAT THEYRE GONNA DO THIS FOR ALL THE SCREENINGS BECAUSE IT WAS THE PREMIERE
I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN TO GO AND SEE THAT
BUT IM REALLY REALLY REALLY GLAD I SAW IT
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE ITS TRUE
EVEN THOUGH I WAS LIKE HU IM GONNA HATE IT
BUT IM JUST GONNA HAVE TO SAY IT
ITS MY FAVORITE FILM EVER
UM ITS NOT MY FAVORITE FILM EVER
BUT I WOULD DEFINATELY WATCH IT AGAIN
I CAN IMAGINE GETTING THIS ON DVD AND WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS AT TIME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL SO LIKE HUH ITS NOT ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION ITS ABOUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER
AND ILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT LIKE THE COOL PREMIERE AND STUFF
BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT THIS UP SOON
WHICH WERE UM A DISASTEROUS
AND I WAS PRETTY OPEN TO TO IT BEING GOOD
I AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE PREVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE STUPID TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
I WAS LIKE THERES NO WAY THAT THEYRE GONNA BE ABLE TO CONVINCE ME THAT A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL CAN TAKE DOWN LIKE SIX ADULT DUDES
SO I SAW SOME OTHER REVIEWS AND I WAS LIKE OKAY I WAS SURPRISED
AND THEY BOTH LIKED IT
THEY S AND ALL THE PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THE THEATRE AND BEYOND THE TRAILER REALLY LIKED IT
AND I GOTTA SAY I WASNT BLOWN AWAY BY IT
I DIDNT THINK IT WAS GREAT OR EPIC OR JUST FANTASTIC
IT WAS GOOD
I MEAN I DONT REGRET SEEING IT
IT WAS IT WAS AN IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE
ERIC BANA DECIDES TO TRAIN TO BE THIS MOST PARANOID ASASSIN CHICK IN THE WORLD
ANYWAYS SKIPPING PAST THAT SHES GOT THIS LIKE KICK A ATTITUDE
SO ITS IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE A SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL TYPE OF MOVIE
ITS GOOD
BUT ITS NOT GREAT
ITS NOT POLISHED QUITE AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE
IT IS GOOD THOUGH
LIKE THEY CONVINCED ME LIKE THIS CHICK COULD PROBABLY TAKE THAT DUDE DOWN WHICH IS PRETTY HARD
BECAUSE I WENT INTO THE MOVIE THINKING THERES NO WAY
AND SO THEY KIND OF EXPLAIN IT A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT REALLY
UM I I AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH UH ONE OF THEM GOES WAS THERE A PLOT TO THIS MOVIE
IT DOESNT HAVE A DEEP SEEDED PLOT
THERES NOT LIKE A REALLY GOOD TWIST
ITS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE
ITS LIKE 00 BOURNE IDENTITY MEETS 00 WILLY WONKA
THERES SOME REALLY STRANGE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
IT WAS IT DID ADD TO THE MOVIE THOUGH IT
AND IT VISUALLY ITS KINDA COOL HOW THEY SHOW HER CONFUSION BECAUSE SHE GROWS UP IN THE WOODS
SO IT IT WAS AND INTERESTING MOVIE
IT WAS ORIGINAL
AND I LIKED IT
THE SOUNDTRACK WAS INTERESTING
UM IT WASNT BAD
BUT IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING
IT WASNT THE IT WASNT THE USUAL
I DID LIKE KIND OF LIKE THE ACTION
THE MUSIC KINDA DROVE A LOT OF THE ACTION
WHICH IS COOL
ITS ONE OF THOSE ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT WE ALL DREAD
NOW THE REAL STAR OF SOMETHING BORROWED IS GINNIFER GOODWIN
ANNOYINGLY SHE KIND OF YELLS AND SCREAMS THROUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE
AND IF YOU CAN TOLERATE HER THE REST OF THE MOVIE ISNT ANY BATTER
UM IT KIND OF FOLLOWS THE PATH OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING 0000 JULIA ROBERTS MOVIE EXCEPT IT TAKES THIRTY MINUTES LONGER TO DEVIATE FROM THE SCRIPTS OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS
BUT MOSTLY ITS JUST KATE HUDSON BEING VERY ANNOYING
AND I THINK ITS PREDICTABLE UP AN TO A POINT
I THINK WITH WITH THESE KIND OF MOVIES WE KIND OF PREDICT
AND WE SECOND GUESS OURSELVES
SO I WILL GIVE IT POINTS FOR NOT BEING EXACTLY LIKE MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING EVEN AT THE TRAILER SETS IT UP THAT WAY
GINNIFER GOODWIN IS FUN TO WATCH
BUT I DONT THINK SHES LEADING MATERIAL
AND LIKE I SAID KATE HUDSON COULDNT BE MORE ANNOYING HERE
IF THERE IS ANY SILVERLINING IN THIS MOVIE ITS JOHN KRASINSKI
WHO I DONT USUALLY LIKE
BUT HE HAS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST SCENES IN THIS MOVIE
HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHARACTER HERE
THIS IS HIS MOST ENGAGING ENDEVOUR YET
AND HE WHAT HE DOES WITH HANNA IS HE MAKES THE MOVIE ON LIKE ANYTHING WEVE SEEN BEFORE
HE TAKES GREAT ACTORS OR ACRESSES IN THIS CASE LIKE SAOIRSE RONAN AND CATE BLANCHETT
AND HE PUTS THEM IN VERY STRANGE AND UNUSUAL CHARACTERS
UM WHAT REALLY NEED ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE CHAMICAL BROTHERS DID THE SOUNDTRACKS WHATS PULSE POUNDING THE ENTIRE WAY THROUGH
YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN
THERES ALL THESE COLORFUL CHARACTERS
NOW IT ISNT A GREAT FANTASTIC TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT THAT KIND OF MOVIE
I GAVE IT A B
BUT I THINK ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THATS SO UNIQUE
THAT YOU RESPECT THAT JOE WRIGHT TRIED TO DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HERE
ITS COLORFUL
ITS IN YOUR FACE
ITS REALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END
AND I THINK UM WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS WAS THAT REALLY TRIED VERY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
AND SOMETHING THAT I CANT FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO
I ALWAYS LIKE TO READ THE BOOK FIRST
ITS A WEIRD THING
BECAUSE PRISCILLA FROM THE READABLES GAVE A SUCH A GOOD REVIEW
UM I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE
IT WAS SO GOOD
UM ITS SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS
UM USUALLY IM NOT REALLY A BIG HUGE SCIFI ALIEN KIND OF FAN
BUT UM IT WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD
UM I REALLY WANNA GO READ THE BOOK NOW
COZ IM SO CURIOUS TO SEE UM HOW THE STORYLINE UM GOT TO THAT POINT
I HEARD THAT IN THE BOOK IT DESCRIBES UM THE PLAN OF THE GLORY A LOT BETTER
UM GIVES MORE DETAILS SO I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT NOW
UM I CANT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT TOO
UM IT IT TURNS OUT THAT JAMES FRAY WHO UM I REALY LIKE
UM HE WROTE A GOOD BOOK
UM AND I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT
IM REALLY EXCITED
UM AS FOR ALEX XXX I AM A NEW ALEX FAN
HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE
SO EASY ON THE EYES
UM I THINK HES MY NEW FAVORITE
YEAH SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS ALL WATCH THIS MOVIE
MILA KUNIS AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE I THOUGHT THEY MADE A GREAT DUO
MILA KUNIS SHE IS GORGEOUS
THERES SOME GREAT BEDROOM SCENES
YOU GUYS ARE YOURE GONNA GET TO ENJOY
A FINE LIGHT WEIGHT DAY MOVIE
I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GOING TO ENJOY THIS MORE THAN THE GUYS
UM CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME SCENES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE GONNA FEEL MORE THE EMOTION OF IT
THERE ARE SOME FUNNY LINES
GREAT STEAMY BEDROOM SCENES
I WAS SURPRISED UM THE AMOUNT OF SKIN THEY SHOWED
BUT UM IT WAS IN A GOOD TASTE
UM AND I THOUGHT WOODY HARELSON WAS A FUNNY
HE UM ADDED A GRAT DIMENSION TO THE MOVIE AS WELL
STORYLINE WAS OK
BUT OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS A FUN PICTURE
I I DO THINK ITS WORTH SEEING
UM CERTIANLY AGAIN MORE OF A DAY MOVIE THAN UM SEEING IT ALONE
UNLESS YOU LADIES GO TOGETHER TO SEE IT TOGETHER
SO ID GO SEE IT
THUMBS UP
THE ACTION IS FUCKING AWESOME
THE ACTION IS REALLY REALLY WELL DIRECTED
ITS VERY REMINSCENT OF DISTRICT
0 ITS LIKE SOMEONE WATCHED THE THIRD ACT OF DISTRICT 0 A BUNCH OF TIMES LIKE LETS MAKE THIS INTO AN ENTIRE MOVIE ITLL BE AWESOME AND THATS PRETTY MUCH WHAT THEY DID HERE
BUT IT DIDNT TURN OUT QUITE NEARLY AS AWESOME AS THAT MOVIE DID
IN FACT THIS MOVIE ISNT EVEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DISTRICT 0 NOR IS IT UM FOR UH BLACK HAWK DOWN WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMPARING IT TO
I DIDNT REALLY SEE A COMPARISON TO BLACK HAWK DOWN UNTIL LIKE THE VERY VERY END
BUT NEVERTHELESS ANOTHER REALLY COOL THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE
THE ALIENS ARE REALLY AWESOME
THEY DESIGNED THE ALIENS IN A REALLY COOL UNIQUE WAY TO MAKE THEM LIKE BIOTIC BUT ALSO MECHANICAL
AND THEY HAVE REALLY COOL TECHNOLOGY THATS REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH LIKE MAKE THEM BLOW UP SHIT AND YOU KNOW
AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE PULL OUT SOMETHING NEW
BUT ITS NOT ALWAYS QUITE EXPLAINED YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ALIENS
BUT THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THEM
LIKE ENOUGH THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A GOOD REASON WHY THEY WHY THEYRE ATTACKING
AND IT KEEPS YOUR INTERESTS IN THE ACTION SCENES AT LEAST DURING THIS MOVIE
UH THE DIALOGUE IS TERRIBLE
THERE IS NO GOOD DIALOGUE
NOTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS CLEVERLY WRITTEN
EVERYTHING THEY SAY JUST SOUNDS SO FUCKING STUPID
THE ONLY ACTOR WHO CAN REALLY SELL THEIR LINES IS ERIN ECKART
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE HE SAYS SOMETHING YOURE LIKE THAT JUST SOUNDED DUMB AS HELL
BUT HE TOTALLY SELLS IT
BUT I KINDA WOULD HAVE READ THAT BEEN LIKE HM I MEAN SCHWARZANEGGER NEVER SAID ANYTHING REALLY THAT BADASS IN HIS MOVIES
BUT ARITE AND MOVING ON THERES NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MOVIE NONE
WELL I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I DONT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY CHARACTERS NONE OF THEM WERE MEMBORABLE
AND THEY WERE ALL JUST REALLY BLAND AND FORGETTABLE
WHICH I WAS NOT EXCITED TO SEE
AND IT ACTUALLY SURPRISED ME
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I I LIKE SHREK I DO
I LIKE THE FIRST TWO SHREKS QUITE A BIT
UM THEYVE BECOME QUITE A BIT OVERRATED
BUT THE FIRST TWO WERE PRETTY EXCELLENT
THE THIRD ONE WAS A PIECE OF CRAP
AND THATS WHY I WAS NOT EXCITED ABOUT THE FOURTH ONE
UM WHICH ACTUALLY WAS REALLY GOOD
I DID LIKE THE FOURTH ONE QUITE A BIT
UM I I DID ENJOY IT
IT REMINDED ME OF THE FIRST ONE HAD THE SAME KIND OF VIBE LIKE THE FIRST ONE
AND IT JUST WAS BETTER
MAYBE ITS THE BABY OGRES MAYBE BRINGING IN THE BABY OGRES REALLY BROUGHT IT DOWN
COZ THE FIRST TWO WERE GREAT AND THEY BROUGHT IN THE KIDS AND IT MADE IT MORE KIDDY FRIENDLY MOVIE
THE FIRST TWO WERE KID MOVIES
BUT THEY WERE HAD ADULT HUMOUR
I THOUGH THAT ADULTS WOULD APPRECIATE
AND WOULD GO OVER THE KIDS HEADS AND THIS IS WHAT THE FOURTH ONE KIND OF HAS
THE THIRD ONE WAS MORE KID HUMOUR THOUGH
IT DIDNT HAVE THAT MUCH ADULT HUMOUR IN IT
UM YEAH THE FOURTH ONE IT DOES HAVE KID HUMOUR DEFINATELLY
ITS A KIDS MOVIE
BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME ADULT HUMOUR
THOSE ARE QUOTE IN THIS MOVIE THAT SOUNDED SO DIRTY COMING OUT
BUT IT AS GREAT
YES UM SOMETHING ABOUT WAFFLE HOLE AM I THE ONLY ONE AM I PERVERTED NOT TO THINK THAT THAT SOUNDS DIRTY COZ IT TOTALLY DOES WAFFLE HOLE
IT HAD ME LAUGHING OUT LOUD
AND I DONT THINK THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT
UM YEAH ITS ITS BETTER THAN THE THIRD ONE ABSOLUTELY
BECAUSE MY ONE OF MY COUSINS DOESNT LIKE THE GLASSES
BUT ITS ACTUALLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT
BECAUSE THE MOVIE ITSELF IS THE SAME OLD CRAP FROM THE SERIES
AND I ACTUALLY AM NOT FINDING THE SERIES TO BE VERY FUN AND POPCORN KIND OF MOVIE
YOU JUST CANT WALK IN EXOPECTING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
IN THIS CASE IT DIDNT TAKE MUCH CONVINCING WHICH IS A LITTLE SILLY
BUT THE ACTING IS BAD
THE PLOT IS YOU KNOW
ACTUALLY THE ACTING IS OK
I GUESS FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE THE PLOT IS IS IS THREADBARE
THE THE UM CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS NIL
BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS MATTER ITS A FUN MOVIE ANYWAY
ITS A POPCORN MOVIE
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE PICTURE
UM BUT UM THIS 0D DEFINATELLY LOOKS A LOT BETTER I THINK THAT REAL D
I HAD IDEAL SEATS
BECAUSE ITS GOOD TO SIT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THEATER WITH 0D
UM BUT THE THEY LOOKED AWESOME
THE 0D ITSELF REALLY HAD IMPROVED
UM THE COLOR LOOKED GREAT
COZ SOMETIMES 0D CAN MESS UP THE COLOR AT LEAST THE OLD ANAGLYPHIC 0D I THINK REAL D IT YOU KNOW HAD SORT OF HAD SORT OF TEMPTED BUT IT WINDS ITSELF ITS ALSO UM NOT IDEAL FOR FOR THE IMIGAE ITSLEF
UM BUT THIS LOOKED AMAZING LOOKED REALLY GOOD
AND IT MAKES IT WORTH GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOUVE GOT UM THE DOLBY 0D SOMEWHERE IN YOUR TOWN
AND I HOPE THIS TAKES OVER AS THE NEW SYSTEM
I WOULD LOVE THAT
THAT BE THAT WOULD BE COOL TO SEE I MEAN
EVENTUALLY WERE GONNA GET BURNED OUT AS A SOCI AS A SOCIETY
ONCE AGIAN WERE GONNA BE BURNED OUT ON 0D
BECAUSE ITS IT IS A GIMMICK ULTMATELLY
UM BUT I WILL SAY UM WITH THIS WITH THIS QUALITY OF 0D YOU COULD ALMOST MAKE YOU KNOW A REGULAR LIKE A DRAMATIC MOVIE OR AN ACTION MOVIE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY GOOD MOVIE AND YOU COULD MAKE IT 0D AND IT WOULDNT AT ALL
YES WHEN YOU HEAR JOHNNY DEPP YOU THINK UH THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE GOOD
IM NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU IT WASNT GOOD
IT WAS REALLY BORING TO ME
CHUCKLING I MEAN AND I DONT ACTUALLY GO AND IM NOT BEING BIASED BECAUSE I DONT REALLY GO FOR THE ANIMATED TYPE FILMS
I GO FOR LIKE THE MORE OLDIES TYPE TYPE FILMS I GUESS LIKE THE OLDER PIXAR FILMS LIKE TOY STORY AND ALL THAT STUFF
UM BUT THIS ONE WAS UH I DONT KNOW I MEAN THE STORY WAS THERE BUT SIGH I DONT KNOW
LAUGHING YOU KNOW A MOVIES TERRIBLE WHEN A PERSON TRYING TO REVIEW IT DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I DONT KNOW THIS MOVIE WAS
UH JOHNNY DEPP DOING THE VOICE WAS FANTASTIC
BUT IT WAS JUST IT WAS LIKE IM NOT GONNA EVEN LIE TO YOU GUYS I FELL ASLEEP AROUND THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WOKE UP LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED
UM ITS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS ARE IN THE COMMERCIAL YOU KNOW YOUVE SEEN THE COMMERCIAL SO MANY TIMES THAT THAT PART ISNT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE AND THEN YOURE WONDERING WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF IT
IT WASNT THERE
IT JUST WASNT IT DI DID NOT WORK FOR ME
THE VOICE ACTING WAS PHENOMENAL
BUT THE THE ACTUAL STORY LINE WAS JUST TERRIBLE
IT WAS SO BAD I JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT
UH I WILL I WILL ACTUALLY SAY THIS RIGHT NOW IT WAS A GOOD WASTE OF LIKE 00
IM NOT EVEN KIDDING I WENT WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND A MOVIES SUPPOSED TO BE TEN TIMES BETTER WHEN YOURE WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
AND UH MY FRIEND NEXT TO ME FELL ASLEEP
AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE JUST BORED
UM YEAH SO WE WERE OUT FOR MOST OF IT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT I WAS TEXTING I JUST LIKE I HAD ABSOLUTELY THE FILM HAD NO DRAW TO ME
THE BEGINNING STARTED OFF GREAT WITH A COUPLE GOOD JOKES
AND REALLY FUNNY UH ANIMATION STUFF IT WAS GREAT REALLY FUNNY
UM AND THEN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE IT WAS LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON
LIKE I DONT UNDERSTAND
LIKE I I ACTUALLY FELT MYSELF CHECKING THE TIME CUZ I WAS LIKE WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO END
I DO NOT WANNA SEE ANY MORE OF THIS
AND I TELL I COULDNT GET OUT OF THAT MOVIE THEATRE FAST ENOUGH
UM IN GENERAL UM THE LITTLE KIDS SEEMED TO LIKE IT THAT WERE IN THERE
BUT THE ADULTS WERE THE ADULTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MY AGE AS WELL WERE LIKE WHAT DID I JUST SEE
I UH JESUS I DONT KNOW IT WAS SIGH ITS SAD THOUGH BECAUSE I EXPECTED SO MUCH MO
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 0D IS REALLY RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR KIDS
AND IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS YOU MAY WANNA CONSIDER SEEING IT ANYWAY
ITS PROBABLY THE BEST THING CURRENTLY IN THEATERS
IT IS ITS A GREAT STORY
ITS A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH
ITS BEAUTIFULLY DONE
AND ITS REALLY WELL WRITTEN
I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT
NUMBER ONE IM GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF THE XXX KIND OF LEAD CHARACTER SORT OF REALLY AWKWARD BOY WHO IS REALLY AWKWARD AND STUFF YOU KNOW IM GETTING SICK OF THAT CHARACTER AND IM TIRED OF IT
AND I GET ANGRY ABOUT IT LAUGHTER XXX DOESNT PLAY BEST CHARACTER IN THE FILM
BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL
SO IM IM IM THROUGH WITH THAT GUY
SECOND THERES ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE IN THIS FILM AND IT IS THE SIZE OF A DRAGON THAT IS BIG AS A MOUNTAIN AND WHEN YOU SEE THE FILM YOULL PROBABLY KNOW WHAT I MEAN
UM THERES NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS THING
AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I COME UP WITH MAKES THIS STORY KIND OF KIND OF CREEPY
OTHER THEN THOSE TWO THINGS THIS IS A REALLY FUN FILM THAT YOU WILL ENJOY UNLESS YOU ARE SOLELESS PIECE OF MACHENERY
AND LET ME TELL YOU IT SURPASSED ITSELF
IT REACHED THE NEW HIGHTS OF HORRENDOUS
THIS MOVIE ISNT JUST BAD ITS DIABOLICAL
FIRST LET ME JUST SAY I SAW QUITE A FEW GUYS AT THE CINEMA WHO CLEARLY BEEN DRAGGED THERE BY THE GIRLFRIENDS AND TO THOSE GUYS I SAY WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SEW YOUR BALLS BACK ON FOR YOU
ALSO IF YOURE A STREIGHT MAN AND YOU VOLUNTARILY WILLINGLY GOO AND SEE THIS FILM IM GONNA NEED YOU TO LIGHT A CANDLE SAY A PRAYER AND ASK YOURSELF SOME QUESTIONS
THIS IS REALLY JUST A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST FILM
WHERE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LIES NOT ENTIRELY SURE
LET ME SEE IF I CAN RUSTLE UP SOME SYMPHATY YEAH IVE GOT NOTHING
I DONT KNOW IF CHARLOTTE STARTED ON MADE ME NEVER WANT TO HAVE KIDS OR NEVER WANT TO HAVE RICH FRIENDS
MIRANDA MIRANDA WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BEST CHARACTERS
IM GONNA GIVE THIS A GRADE B MINUS
THE CGI WORK THE 0D IS SPECTACULAR
THE FLYING SEQUENCES ARE BEAUTIFUL
AND THE OWLS ARE REALLY WONDERFUL
AND COME OF REAL
AND THEY DO HAVE VERY NICE PERSONALITES
BUT THE STORY IS VERY DARK
IN FACT MY SIX YEARS OLD WAS SCARED MOST OF THE MOVIE
UM MY OTHER COMPLAINT OTHER THAN THAT THERES LIKE NOTHING LIGHT OR FUNNY IN THIS STORY TO BREAK UP THE SLUMBER MOOD IS THE BATTLE ITSELF
YOU CANT TELL WHICH ARE THE GOOD OWLS WHICH ARE THE BED OWLS
THEY REALLY NEEDED TO SOMEHOW SET THEM APART WITH ARMOR
ANYWAY THIS IS ONE YOU CAN SKIP
OR YOU CAN SEE UP TO YOU
AND HE REALLY SEEMS TO BE CHANNELING MICHAEL BAY IN THIS MOVIE
THE PLOT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF SWISS CHEESE
AND ITS REALLY GLOSSED OVER WITH LOTS OF STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS AND BIG EXPLOSIONS
SIGH ALL IN ALL ITS KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANY OF US WHO GREW UP IN THE 00S AND ARE USED TO THE TOYS IN THE CARTOON
I FEEL LIKE IT ALMOST SHOULD HAVE HAD A G RATING
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF DUMB DOWN FOR US
AND I HATE TO SAY THAT
I THINK YOU WILL REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE 0
BUT IF YOU ARE A CHILD WHO GREW UP IN THAT TIME PERIOD YOURE NOT GOING TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH
BECAUSE THEY ARENT PLAYING TO YOU THEYRE PLAYING TO A NEW AUDIENCE OF KIDS WHO DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND ALL I CAN IS HES A PRETTY AVERAGE GUY
I DONT REALLY FEEL ANY EMOTIONAL PULL FROM HIM IN THIS MOVIE
MARLON WAYANS KIND OF PLAYS A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF HIMSELF FROM OTHER MOVIES
HE DOES SOME STEREOTYPICAL THINGS LIKE TALKING UH ABOUT BUSTING A CAP WHILE FLYING AN AIRPLANE
AND HES PRETTY AVERAGE TOO
THE TWO WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD LOOKING
AND SO THATS PRETTY ENTERTAINING
THIS IS A REALLY BIG MOVIE FOR THEIR CAREERS BECAUSE I HAVENT REALLY SEEN THEM IN A LOT OF BIG MOVIES
AND HIS PERFORMANCE IS CAMPY AND COMES OFF AS AN ARMY CHEERLEADER SOME OF THE TIME
HE IS AVERAGE
AND ITS SH SO SHORT LIVED HE BARELY NEEDS TO EVEN BE THERE
UH STORMSHADOW IS VERY COOL
HIS FIGHT SEQUENCES ARE VERY NEAT
AND HE DELIVERS A LOT OF INTENSITY
WHICH IS A REBOOT I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE BEST TERM FOR THE I BELIEVE IT WAS A 0000 MOVIE CLASH OF THE TITANS
UM UNFORTUNATELLY IM GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE
UM I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
I WAS A LITTLE HASITANT AT FIRSTYOU KNOW AS YOU ARE WITH WITH REBOOTS YOU KNOW
IS IT GONNA BE GOOD
BUT AS THE TRAILERS CAME OUT I I REALLY LIKED WHAT I WAS SEEING
I THINK THAT MUSIC THAT MUSIC THEY KIND OF PULL IT WITH THE SOUNDTRACK REALLY GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT SEEING THIS MOVIE
AND AND BEING A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL I WAS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IT
BUT TO ME SOMEONE NEEDS TO RELEASE THE CRACKON ON THIS MOVIE AND JUST TOTALLY DESTROY IT
BECAUSE I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A RUSHED MOVIE
IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NO STORY DEVELOPMENT IN IT
UM I JUST REALLY DIDNT HAVE GOOD TIME
I FELT LIKE MEDUSA REALLY WASNT THAT SCARY
MAYBE IT WAS COZ I WAS A KID BACK AT THAT DAY BUT MEDUSA WAS A LOT SCAR SCARIER THEN
UM I JUST THINK THEY MADE HER ALMOST LOOKED TOO YOU KNOW THEY TRIED THAT YOU KNOW MAKE HER LOOK TOO BEAUTIFUL
BUT UM I JUST IN WHOLE REALLY DIDNT LIKE THIS MOVIE
THE SCREEN YOU KNOW WAS THAT I I KIND OF FO FOUND MYSELF YOU KNOW WANTED TO LAY MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE A NAP
AND ACTUALLY THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME ACTUALLY WAS TAKING A NAP LAUGHTER HE KEPT DOZING OFF
AND AND AFTER THE MOVIE UM GOING OUT INTO THE THEATER INTO THE LOBBY I HAD NOONE I HEARD NOONE SAY ANYTHING GOOD
AND MY FRIEDNS WHO WERE THERE HAD NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT IT
SO UNFORTUNATELLY I MUST SAY THIS ONE IS PROBABLY GONNA BE WAITING UNTIL IT COMES ON HBO
OR GET IT AT UM UM RED BOX FOR A BUCK
UM I JUST REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT
UM BUT HEY IF YOURE LOOKING TO SPEND SOME MONEY UM GO CHECK IT OUT MAYBE YOU WILL LIKE IT
BUT UM FROM MY REVIEW IM GONNA SAY IM GONNA GIVE IT TWO THUMBS DOWN
RELEASE THE CRACKEN ON THIS MOVIE DONT GO SEE IT GO SEE SOMETHING ELSE HOW TO TRAIN THE DRAGON AND UM THATS ALL IM GONNA SAY ABOUT THAT
SO DISAPPOINTMENT DEFINATELY
I DID NOT WANNA GIVE THIS MOVIE A BAD REVIEW
I IM A FAN OF THE ORIGINAL YOU KNOW LOVED IT
AND UM BUT I GOT TO I GOT TO DO MY DUTY AND LET YOU GUYS KNOW ITS A A MAJOR SUCK FEST
HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SCREENINGS ON THAT
AND UM LOOKING REALLY FORWARD TO SEEING THAT MOVIE
IT COULDVE BEEN BETTER
THE FIRST ONE WAS A LOT BETTER
THEY COULDVE MADE ZEUS A LITTLE LESS SPARKLY IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING
UM IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW
THE FIRST ONE MADE MORE SENSE
AND THE CRACKON YOU KNOW IN THE PREVIEW IS LIKE SO MUCH HYPE
THEY PRETEND THERES GONNA BE THIS BIG SCENE IT MAYBE LASTS ABOUT A MINUTE AND I WAS LIKE IS THAT IT
AND THAN ITS DEFINATELLY NOT A 0D MOVIE
THE PREVIEWS ARE MUCH MORE 0D THE NE SO YEAH IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING
I GIVE IT ABOUT ONE AND A HALF STARS
SO THATS THUMBS DOWN IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
SO IT IS NOT A BUY
BUT THE CGI WAS GREAT
AND THATS EXECTLY HOW I THOUGHT A GIANT SCORPION WOULD LOOK WITH THE PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD THAT HAD BLUE FIRE ON IT
UM MEDUSA WAS WAY DIFFERENT FROM PERCY JACKSON AND GLANDON LAWS
BUT THE BEST PART ABOUT THE MOVIE I VE GOT A FREE PAIR OF GLASSES
AND A GUY WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE TOM CRUISE
UM LIP SMACKING THIS MOVIE IS DUMB
UH I PERSONALLY THINK ITS A WASTE OF MONEY
JUST BECAUSE I CANT STAND MOVIES THAT ARE SO PREDICTABLE
LAUGHING I JUST JUST CANT STAND MOVIES WHERE ITS LIKE THE SAME PLOT AS LIKE 00 OTHER MILLION MOVIES
JUST DIFFERENT JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE PLAYING THE ROLES
I REALLY DONT CARE TO SEE THOSE
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I TOOK A CHANCE
YOU KNOW I LIKE KATE HUDSON
SO I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WOULD BE FUNNY
AND DONT GET ME WRONG THERE WERE YOU KNOW FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE
I JUST DONT CARE FOR THE PLOT
I DONT CARE FOR BASICALLY ANY OF IT
BECAUSE ITS PREDICTABLE
ITS THE SAME YOU KNOW RISE AND FALL
BUT SHES IN TROUBLE YOU KNOW CUZ SHE DOESNT WANNA TELL HER BEST FRIEND BLAH BLAH BLAH
AND SO SHES ALL SAD WALKING IN THE RAIN BLAH BLAH BLAH
AND BLAH BLAH BLAH
IVE BEEN SAYING THAT A LOT IN THIS VIDEO BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
UM YEA SO ANYWAYS ITS REALLY PREDICTABLE
I MEAN YOU CAN GO SEE I PERSONALLY DIDNT LIKE IT
BECAUSE I JUST GOT REALLY BORED WITH IT
UM AND ITS REALLY UNPREDICTABLE
I JUST GET SO TIRED OF UNPREDICTABLE MOVIES
THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY AND UM STUPID FOR MOVIES HAD THIS REALLY LONG LIKE REALLY NOT REALLY LONG BUT LIKE REALLY INTENSE RENT A ABOUT IT
UM AND IT IT IS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY SAYING IT IS BAD
I DONT THINK ITS LIKE THE WORST MOVIE IVE EVEN SEEN JUST THIS YEAR
BUT I WOULD SAY I I ENJOYED SUCKER PUNCH
LIKE I WAS MORE ENTERTAINED BY IT THAN BATTLE LA WHICH WAS JUST A SLOG AND BORING AND I JUST TRY TO TOTALLY UNINTERESTING
AND SUCKER PUNCH IS A FAILER BUT LIKE A REALLY AMBITIOUS WEIRD THE INTERESTING IDIOSYNCRATIC FAILURE
UM IT IS BAD
BUT ITS NOT BAD I THINK THE WAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ITS BAD
ITS NOT BAD IN THE WAY I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE BAD
UM IT REALLY IS NOT TRYING TO BE A DRAMATIC FILM OR AN ACTION FILM
LIKE I THINK MOST PEOPLE THATS THEIR KNOCK ON IT IS THAT ITS NOT YOU KNOW CONVENTIONALLY SATISFYING AS LIKE YOU KNOW WITH DRAMA THAT WE DONT GET TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS THEIR PLAY ISNT INTERESTING THEIR PATH TO FREEDOM IS NOT COMPELLING AND ITS BASICALLY TELESCOPED WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF THE MOVIE WHERE WERE SORT OF TOLD WHATS GONNA HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENS
UM AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT I DONT THINK ITS TRYING TO BE THAT
I THINK ITS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE A MUSICAL
AND I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND SILLY COZ ITS SUCH A BROAD GOOFY MAINSTREAM CULT KIND OF MOVIE
BUT IT REALLY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A MUSICAL OR AND OPERA OR EVEN A BALLET THAN A REGULAR NARRATIVE FILM
COZ LIKE AM REMAINS IN NARRATIVE FILM IS ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND PLOT AND THEN SPECTACLE LIKE IN THIRD PLACE
SO ITS LIKE PUTS SOME PEOPLE IN IT AND YOURE GONNA ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH THEM
THERERE SOME FUNNY DIALOGUE
MAKE THEM COMPELLING IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS COMPELLING AND THEN HAVE A STORY THATS LIKE AT FIVE MINUTES THIS HAPPENS AND AT TEN MINUTES THIS HAPPENS THAT LIKE MOVES FORWARD AND HAS MOMENTUM
AND THEN YOU KNOW PUT IN SOME ACTION OR SOME ROMANCE OR SEX OR WHATEVER LIKE TO KEEP PEOPLE SORT OF ENGAGED
UM AND THATS WHAT TRADITIONL NARRATIVE MOVIES DO
AND THIS MOVIE IS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE THE PLOT IS WHAT LITTLE THERE IS
AND THE CHARACTERS ARE THEY ARE ALL JUST PLACE HOLDERS
ITS REALLY LIKE LIKE IF YOU WENT TO GO SEE THE BALLET AND ITS ABOUT THE SPECTACLES
LIKE THE STORY OF SWAN LAKE IS WHY PEOPLE GO SEE SWAN LAKE ITS THE MOVEMENT AND THE DANCING AND THE MUSIC AND THE SETS AND THE EXPERIENCE
BUT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE
ID GIVE IT THREE STARS
ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS VERY PREDICTABLE VERY PREDICTABLE
BUT VERY PREDICTABLE
THAT UM I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT WAS THAT UM THE JOKES WERE REALLY CHEESY
I DONT LIKE CHEESY JOKES BUT CHEESY JOKES ARE MOST TIMES FUNNY CUZ THEYRE REALLY BAD
SO IF THATS THE CASE THEN YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU REALLY LIKE CHEESY JOKES PREDICTABLE MOVIES BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A PERFECT FAMILY MOVIE
I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE 0 OR YOUNGER KIDS TO THAT MOVIE ITS A DEFINITE FAMILY MOVIE
BEYOND THIS AGE THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE MOVIE THEATRE IS THERE WERE KIDS CRYING THE WHOLE TIME AND WHISPERING XXX DOES BABY CRYING GET ON YOUR NERVES EVER IF IT DOES WOULDNT RECOMMEND GOING TO THIS MOVIE CUZ THERES A BUNCH OF KIDS OR SNEAK INTO A REALLY LATE SHOWING CUZ I DONT THINK KIDS ARE GOING TO BE OUT THAT LATE BUT THATS THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH IT
OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE
IT WAS CUTE YOU KNOW THE ACTORS DID A GREAT JOB BRINGING THE SMURFS TO LIFE SUCH AS JOE GEORGE LOPEZ NEIL PATRICK HARRIS KATY PERRY AND A FOURTH
IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE AND I LOVED IT
BUT I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS SO I DIDNT LOVE IT I LIKED IT
THREE STARS FOR SMURFS AND STAY SMURFY EVERYONE
I WENT TO THIS MOVIE VERY VERY EXCITED
IM A BIG TRANSFORMERS FAN
I THINK UM THE MOVIES ARE PHENOMENAL ESPECIALLY THAT FIRST ONE
UM I DONT THINK THAT THIS OVE GOT AS MUCH BUZZ AND AS MUCH UM MEDIA ATTENTION AND UM WORD OF MOUTH YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND AND STUFF
UM IN INTERVIEWS SHIA LABEOUF SAID THAT THE SECOND MOVIE LACKED UM HEART
AND HE SAID THAT THIS NEW ONE HAS A LOT OF HEART UM SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE
UM AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DONT REALLY THINK THATS NECESSARILY TRUE UM I THINK THAT THE SECOND MOVIE AND THE THIRD MOVIE ARE VERY VERY SIMILAR UM I THINK THEY TRIED TO ADD A LOT OF HEART
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN THEYRE ALREADY TELLING EACH OTHER THAT LOVE EACH OTHER AND TALKING ABOUT GETTING WEDDING RINGS SPENDING THE REST OF THEIR LIVES TOGETHER THEY LIVE TOGETHER I MEAN ITS JUST WAY TOO MUCH TOO FAST THEY TRY TO BUILT THEIR HEART INTO IT BY YOU KNOW HIM SAYING YOU KNOW YOURE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THIS WORLD YOU KNOW I DONT CARE ABOUT MYSELF YOU KNOW COZ SHE THINKS HES DOING CRAZY STUFF SACRIFIZING HIS LIFE IN A THEN HE DOES CRAZY STUFF TO SAVE HER AND HES JUST LIKE I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW JUST ALL THE SAPPY BLAH BLAH STUFF
THERES TOO MUCH TOO FAST I MEAN WE BASICALLY JUST GET INTRODUCED TO THIS CHARACTER AND YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY UM THIS IS THE FIRST MOVIE SHES IN AND THEYRE ALREADY UM YOU KNOW UM MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND ALL THAT GOOD SLUSHY STUFF
THIS MOVIE SEEMED UM A LITTLE LONG
I LOVE MY MOVIES TO BE LONG
I DONT THINK A MOVIE CAN EVER BE TOO LONG UM YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU KNOW THE DARK NIGHT WAS YOU KNOW TWO HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU KNOW AND TITANIC YOU KNOW ALL THOSE MOVIES A AVATAR ALL THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU KNOW THREE HOURS AND YOU KNOW THATS FINE BY ME I LOVE LONG MOVIES
UM IM PASSIONATE ABOUT MOVIES SO THATS FINE
BUT THIS ONE SEEMED LONG AT SOME AT SOME PARTS
SOME PARTS JUST KIND OF DRAGGED ON YOU KIND OF YOU KNOW SIT IN THE MOVIE THEATER AND THIS IS A BIG ACTION MOVIE ONE OF THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF THE SUMMER AND YOU KIND OF JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW REST YOUR HEAD WHILE WATCHED UM COZ SOME OF THE SEQUENCES AND SOME OF THE SCENES WERE JUST KIND OF LONG
AND YOU JUST KIND OF LIKE OK LETS GET TO IT WE KNOW WHATS GONNA HAPPEN LETS GO AHEAD AND DO IT
UM THE ACTION WAS GREAT YOU KNOW NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE JUST UM JUST ENOUGH ACTION
UM THE STORY WAS ALL RIGHT
BUT PRETTY GOOD SCRIPT
I DONT THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE OBVIOUSLY I I THINK THE FIRST MOVIE WAS JUST FANTASTIC
UM MAYBE IM PART WITH THE SECOND ONE MAYBE IM LITTLE BEHIND THAT BUT IT WAS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD STORY
NOTHING NEW IS BROUGHT IN THOSE PREDATOR SERIES NO SURPRISES NO BIG TWIST NO FINISH
I LIKE TO TEASE SOME MYSTERY AND GREAT PLOT WHAT COULDVE BEEN BUT THAN ALL IS EXPLAINED AND DISPPEARES TEN MINUTES LATER ITS JUST A CLEAR REMAKE OF PREDATOR FROM BACK IN 0000 WITH THE PREMISE BEING ALMOST IDENTICAL
ALTHOUGHT WHAT WASNT THE SAME WAS THE CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER WHICH FIRST MOVIE HAD AND THIS ONE NOT
IN THE FIRST RUN THEY WERE A TEAM AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER AND YOU SEE THE PERSONALITES THIS MOVIE JUST POPS A GROUP OF DIFFERENT KILLERS DOWN TOGETHER AND LETS THEM INTERACT POORLY
YOU DONT SEE ANY OF THE PERSONALITIES WHEN ONE DIES YOU DONT MOURN OVER THAM AN YOU DONT GET AN ATTACHMENT TO ANYBODY
OF THE ACTING NOTHING STANDS OUT A SPECTACULAR WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED OF THE MOVIE LIKE THIS
BUT NOTHING SUCKS EITHER WHICH GAINS THE MOVIE SOME POINTS I GUESS
WHAT DISAPPOINTED ME WAS THAT ONE OF THE MOST HYPED ACTORS IN THE MOVIE WAS ONLY IN THERE FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
AND I KNOW YOU CANT HYPE A MOVIE WITH AN UNKNOWN ACTORS SO EVEN IF SOMEONE IS IN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU SHOULD HYPE THEM
BUT ITS JUST A LITTLE WEAK OVERALL FOR ME THAN WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM AND HE WAS GONE QUICKLY
ALTHOUGH WHAT IT DID DO WAS INTERESTING BUT I BUT IT DIDNT MAKE SENSE
HE CO LAURENCE FISHBURNE COMES IN AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS THINGS THAT ONLY SCREEN WRITERS SHOULDVE KNOWN ABOUT WHICH GIVES A LITTLE MORE OF F FONY FEEL THIS WHOLE THING
JUST LIKE ONE OF THE GIRLS TELLS THE EXACT STORY OF THE FIRST MOVIE
ITS A POINTLESS SCENE FOR THE AUDIENCE AND THE CHARACTERS
IT DOSENT GIVE AN GIVE ANY INSIGHT OR HELP ITS JUST MAKE THEM SEEM LIKE SHE SA SHE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE
IN FINALE I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR A RENTAL NON IN THEATER BECAUSE ITS A LOW GRADE SEQUAL TO THE 00TH VERSION AND ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE SERIES
WHAT CAN I SAY IM JUST CURIOUS
DONT GET ME WRONG KATE HUDSON IS IS PRETTY FINE LOOKING BUT I JUST THINK ITS KIND OF STUPID EVERYONE SAYS HAS A FAT ASS
YES SHE HAS A FAT ASS IN TERMS OF WHITE GIRLS BUT HER ASS ISNT REALLY THAT FAT
FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS BORING
I MEAN THE MOVIE REALLY WASNT FUNNY AT ALL
ALL THE ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WERENT FUNNY
I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS I GUESS IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
I WA HEY SHE MIGHT LIKE IT BUT EVEN THEN ITS NOT REALLY FUNNY AT ALL
ANNE HATHAWAY IS REALLY OVER RATED IN MY OPINION
I MEAN HER ACTING IS LIKE SO SO AND I CANT BELIEVE SHE EVEN WON A OSCAR BELEIVE SHE WON AN OSCAR OR FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS OR BEST ACTRESS SOMETHING
I MEAN THAT MOVIE WAS A WASTE OF TIME
ITS TWO GIRLS TRYING TOO HARD
AND IT JUST REALLY WASNT GOOD
I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE FILM
BUT THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS JUST A LITTLE DRY
IT DIDNT HAVE A WHOLE OUT OF HUMOR GOING ON WITH IT AT LEAST NONE THAT REALLY MADE YOU WANNA LAUGH OUT LOUD
UM EVEN THE KIDS AND THE AUDIENCE ITSELF JUST KIND OF CHUCKLED A LITTLE BIT GAVE A FEW LAUGHS
NOW IM NOT GONNA LIE THERERE A FEW PARTS THAT HAVE GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN ANIMATED FILM IT DID HAVE SOME GREAT FIGHT SCENES
UM BUT AS FAR AS HUMOR GOES NOT AS MUCH AS I WAS EXPECTING
EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE TRAILER ITSELF WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE HUMOR YOURE GONNA SEE IN THE MOVIE
UM UM A YOU KNOW ALONG WITH THE XXX I WOULD PROBABLY SAYING GO SEE THIS MOVIE AN EARLY SHOWING DONT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE NIGHT VIEWING
UM MAYBE BETTER LIKE NEXT TIME DREAMWORKS BUT FOR THIS ONE FOR ME IT JUST WASNT WHAT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE
I LOVE THE SHREK FILMS
I LIKED ANTS
BUT AS FAR AS KUNG FU PANDA GOES I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE IT JUST WASNT THERE FOR ME I DONT KNOW
MAIN DRAW FOR ME FOR THIS MOVIE WAS JUST THE FACT THAT ITS SET IN THIS LIKE RIDICULOUS WORLD WITH ALL THESE BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES
AND I DONT THINK THATS A VERY GOOD MOVIE
BUT I DO THINK ITS A VERY INTERESTING ONE
I CAN TELL YOU THAT TRON LEGACY IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE
BUT I WAS STILL RIDICILOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY IT
ARE THESE TWO THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME SENTANCEI I REALLY DO THINK SO
TRON LEGACY IS A MOVIE WHERE ON MOST COUNTS THAT I JUDGE MOVIES IT KIND OF FAILS
THE PERFORMANCES ARE NAH
THE SCRIPT CAN BE HORRIBLE
ITS ITS A BIT OF A MIXED BAG COZ THERE WERE SOME VERY BRIGHT MOMENTS
UM THE DIRECTION IS A BIT ITS WOBBLY
BASICALLY A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT I COULD TAKE A MOVIE ON ITS REALLY WOBBLY
BUT WHAT IT LACKS IN THOSE AREAS IT MOST DEFINATELY MAKES UP FOR JUST LIKE SHEER VISUAL SPECTACLE
I MEAN THIS MOVIE HAS THE MOST GORGEOUS VISUALS OUT OF ANY MOVIES SINCE PROBABLY AVATAR ME IF NOT PRETTIER
SO MANY MOMENTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE JUST FRAMED AND LIT SO PERFECTLY THAT SO THAT YOU JUST GO LIKE KIND OF HUH THATS REALLY REALLY COOL
AND THEN TAKE THAT WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN SET LIKE A CRAP TUNNEL OF REALLY KINETIC REALLY WELL DONE ACTION SEQUENCES IN IT AND YOU HAVE TRON LEGACY
IT IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE I KNOW
AND BASICALLY THIS MAKES NO SENSE
NOW THIS MOVIE IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT
HER ACTING WAS PRETTY BAD
SHE DIDNT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR ME
BUT THE REAL STAR THAT FELL OUT OF THIS MOVIE WAS WILLIAM FICHTNER CHARACTER OR WILLIAM FICHTNER
AND HIS ACTING WASNT REALLY GOOD IN THAT MOVIE
BUT IT MADE IT HYSTERICAL AND IT WAS JUST FUNNY WITH ALL OF THESE LITTLE ONE LINERS THAT HE HAD
AND WHATEVER SO NO IM NOT SAYING THIS MOVIE IS BAD COZ ITS ITS NOT
LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT HAD TACKY ONE LINERS THAT WERE JUST HYSTERICAL
IT WAS IT WAS GOOD
UM ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I WAS DISAPPOINTED THOUGH WAS I FELT THAT THEY COULDVE DONE A LOT MORE WITH 0D
AND SOME REALLY COOL GUN FIGHTS
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE MORE THAN THAT BUT SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THAT
UM NOW I DONT REALLY RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU GO ON A DATE WITH SOME GIRL
UM BUT IF YOURE XXX MOVIE GOER LIKE I AM I TOTALLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS BECAUSE ITS JUST A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL ENJOYE IT
THE VERDICT IS STUPID AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY
BUT IT WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE GOING
LIKE I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD
BUT ITS JUST SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY FOR THEM LIKE WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE THATS OBVIOUSLY HAD A VERY BIG BUDGET AND IT IS LIKE NOT EVEN GOOD IT MAKES ME ANGRY COZ IM JUST LIKE WHY ARE YOU WASTING SO MUCH MONEY
AAAAA IT WASNT EVEN HOLDING MY ATTENTION
I COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE MOVIE
I HONESTLY WANTED THE ALIENS TO WIN
ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST SO UNLIKABLE
JUST THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHARACTER THE DOCTOR HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON I EVEN REALLY CARED ABOUT
AND EVEN HE WAS A DOUCHEBAG ALL OF THEM
EVERY SINGLE COWBOY WAS JUST A COMPLETE DOUCHEBAG
AND THERE WAS JUST THIS LITTLE BOY AND HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WASNT A DOUCHEBAG
BUT HE WASNT EVEN INTERESTING
BUT THEY GAVE HIM NO NO CHARACTER LIKE HE HAD NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHATSOEVER
HE WAS JUST LIKE A PLOT DEVICE FOR THIS OTHER GUY TO START ACTING LIKE A FATHER FIGURE AND HE WAS JUST STUPID BUT THEN HE DIDNT EVEN ACT LIKE A FATHER FIGURE TOWARDS HIM
BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY COMPLETE DOUCHEBAG
WHY ARE YOU KILLING EVERYONE
IT JUST SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE OH HES SO COOL HES SO AWESOME LIKE YOUVE NEVER SEEN THAT IN THE MOVIE THIS PERSON WHO HAD AMNESIA JUST KILLS EVERYBODY EVEN IF ITS LIKE BUT THAT WAS SO UNNECESSARY
WHAY ARE YOU KILLING THESE PEOPLE YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHATS GOING ON LIKE DUDE GET OVER YOURSELF
HE LOOKED AWESOME WHILE HE DID IT BUT YEAH OK SO LET ALL THE GIRLS WHO WANT ALL DISAGREE WITH ME COZ THEY ALL THINK THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE BUT THEY ALL THINK HE WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THEY WERE STARING AT DANIEL CRAIG THE WHOLE TIME THEYR GOING OH MY GOSH HES SO HOT
ALL THE GUYS THAT WENT WERE PRETTY MUCH ON MY PAGE THEY WERE JUST LIKE WOW THAT WAS STUPID WOW
I SAT WITH THE GUYS AND WE ALL TRY TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH IT UM AND KEPT FALLING ASLEEP AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW STUPID IT WAS
I DONT REALLY KNOW I DONT ITS SO WEIRD
I THERE WERE TIMES IN THE MOVIE WHERE I FELT REALLY BORED
AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST SITTING THERE AFTER THEY SAID THEIR JOKES AND I WAS LIKE THATS NOT NOBODYS LAUGHING THATS NOT FUNNY
I JUST DONT THINK IT WAS VERY GOOD
AND THIS IS THE THING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS AND NO STRINGS ATTACHED THEY ARE THE SAME MOVIE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING TO THE SAME POINT BUT ITS THE SAME POINT
SO I THINK THAT NO STRINGS ATTACHED WAS BETTER THAN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS
I WAS NOT BORED DURING NO STRINGS ATTACHED
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY
UM AND UH FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS HAD ITS MOMENTS
BUTSIGH IT HAD A LOT OF REALLY BAD MOMENTS
AND HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER
HE IS BRILLIANT THERE IS NOT A MOVIE THAT I SEE HIM IN THAT I DONT END UP CRYING BECAUSE HE IS SO FANTASTIC AND HE JUST BREAKS YOUR HEART WHENEVER HE DOES YOU KNOW A ROLE THAT USUALLY HIS ROLES DO BREAK YOUR HEART AT SOME POINT SO DEFINITELY DID IN THIS MOVIE
I LIKE TEARED UP IN FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HIM
THE LADY WHO PLAYS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKES SISTER UM I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN THIS MOVIE
AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST LIKE REALLY NATURAL AND FUNNY
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE RENEE ZELLWEGGER AND HELEN HUNT FROM A TWISTER MOVIE
AND SHE TALKS LIKE HER TOO
IT WAS WEIRD
THE WHOLE TIME I SAW HER ALL I THOUGHT WAS HELEN HUNT AND RENEE ZELLWEGGER
ANOTHER THING WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP OR POSITIVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN THIS WHOLE MOVIE
BUT THATS KIND OF DEPRESSING
NOW I AM A HUGE HUGE FAN OF NICHOLAS SPARKS
UM THE NOTEBOOK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS
UM I REALLY ENJOYED A WALK TO REMEMBER ME AND DEAR JOHN
I REALLY DID ENJOY AS WELL WASNT TOO FOND OF THE ENDING
SO I WENT INTO THIS FILM HAVING QUITE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
I MEAN ITS A NICHOLAS SPARKS BOOK IT MUST BE GOOD
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS REALLY UM WARY OF GOING
LIKE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MILEY CYRUS UM I MEAN SHES ONLY DONE THE HANNAH MONTANA FRANCHISE PLAYING THAT ONE CHARACTER WHICH I THINK LIKE 00 OF THE PERCENT OF THE TIME HER CHARACTERS LIKE SO OVERBOARD SHES SO EXAGGERATED SO I REALLY DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THIS FILM
STRAIGHT AWAY MILEY CYRUS ACTING MILEY CYRUS ACTING OR LACK OF SHE HAD THIS SAME EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM
IT WAS LIKE THIS LIKE POUTY LIKE GRUMPY LOOK
AND THEN MAYBE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPY LIKE SHE WOULDNT FROWN HER UM FROWN HER EYEBROWS BUT SHED STILL BE POUTY BUT LIKE YEAH LIKE THAT
WHICH JUST UH IT REALLY ANNOYED ME
LIKE THOSE THO THOSE THOSE MOMENTS IN THE FILM ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING WHERE SHE WOULD SIT THERE STAND THERE CROSS UM WITH HER ARMS CROSSED AND JUST LOOK OUT INTO THE DISTANCE LIKE JUST LAUGHING WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION OR SHED LOOK ACROSS THE BEACH OR SHED LOOK AT HER DAD OR SHED LOOK AT HER BROTHER WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION AND I WAS JUST LIKE WHATRE YOU THINKING I I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CHARACTERS DOING
LIKE OKAY SHES STARING WHATS SHE THINKING HOW DOES SHE FEEL I HAD NO IDEA LIKE IT WAS THE SAME EXPRESSION FOR SHOCK OR FOR SADNESS OR WHAT I PRESUMED SHED BE SAD BUT IT SIGH IT REALLY BUGGED ME
BUT AS AN ACTOR I REALLY THINK ESPECIALLY AN ACTOR IN THE LEAD LEADING ROLE YOU REALLY SHOULD PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE
I WAS LIKE HOW CAN YOU GO INTO A FILM INTO A LEADING ROLE AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOUR CHARACTER IS
SMACKING SO THATS PROBABLY WHY SHE JUST LAUGHINGLOOKED THE SAME IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE THERE WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWO SCENES THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT YEA SHE THIS IS HER ACTING THIS IS GOOD SHE CAN DO THIS
BUT THEN THOSE TWO MOMENTS JUST GOT RUINED BY THE REST OF AN HOUR AND A HALF OF HER BEING POUTY
UM ID LIKE TO QUICKLY TALK ABOUT MACHETE
IM SORRY AND DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THIS I DIDNT LIKE IT
I COULDNT GET INTO IT
I KNOW IT ITS NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY MAYBE 00S EXPLOITATION MOVIES ARE MORE CHEESY THAN MACHETE
AND MAYBE PLANET TERROR IM IM NOT SURE IM JUST
SOUND OF CARS THE ACTION AND HUMOR WERE MOSTLY FLAT
I I CANT EXPLAIN WHY THE HUMOR WAS WAS MOSTLY FLAT BECAUSE A FEW OR SEVERAL JOKES ACTUALLY FELT THEY THEY THEY ACTUALLY FELT FELT FUNNY
BUT BUT I JUST DID DIDNT LAUGH
SIGH IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HELPED IF I WENT WITH WITH SOMEONE IF AT LEAST ONE OTHER ONE OTHER PERSON WENT WITH ME
SMACKING LIPS MAYBE ONLY 0 JOKES MADE ME LAUGH
AND UH ALTHOUGH LIKE I LIKE DARK HUMOR
BUT I JUST COULDNT FIND IT FUNNY
NO I I I GUESS SO I MEAN ITS ITS IT WASNT ANNOYING
IT IT IT WAS JUST THERE I I I I WASNT I WASNT AMUSED
MAYBE A LOT MORE THAN THE EXPENDABLES
BUT I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WASNT REALLY CONCERNED WITH BEING EXCITING
THE ACTION FEELS THAT ITS UM IT ITS ITS PRETTY MUCH JUST UH QUICK CUT OR SLASH BLOOD SCREAM YOU KNOW LIP SMACKING
FFFFLAT SHIT LIP SMACKING
STILL THE THE CHURCH SHOOTOUT HOWEVER BRIEF THAT WAS IT IT WAS ALRIGHT
MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN 00 SECONDS LONGER
UM RONNY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE LAST MOVIE WE SAW IN THEATRES AND TO GIVE A REVIEW FOR IT
UM I THINK THE LAST MOVIE I SAW IN THEATRES WAS TOY STORY 0 AND I HATED IT
I REALLY DID
I THINK IM GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE IM JUST NOT ENTERTAINED BY DISNEY PIXAR MOVIES ANYMORE BECAUSE I COULDNT STAND UP
AND I REALLY HATED CARS
I LIKED FINDING NEMO
AND I LIKED WALLY
I DIDNT THINK IT WAS FUNNY
I DIDNT THINK IT WAS CUTE
I DIDNT THINK IT WAS SAD
I JUST HATED IT
LIKE SERIOUSLY
TWO OUT OF FIVE STARS
I GUESS IM JUST OVER IT
I KIND OF HAVE A UM ARTISTIC VIDEO UP ON MY MAIN CHANNEL
I LOVE YOU GUYS
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER NAME FOR THE MOVIE
AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT
THE COUNTRYSIDE WHICH THEY SHOWED WHILE GOING ACROSS IRELAND WAS ASTOUNDINGLY BLE BEAUTIFUL
AND IN THE SCENE WITH THE DESTROYED CASTLE IT REALLY REMINDED ME WHY I WANT TO GO THERE SO BADLY
ALTHOUGH I ENJOYED THE MOVIE
IF I THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY THE PLOT WASNT THAT GREAT
ITS A FUN CHICK FLICK
BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT DOESNT REALLY HOLD UP UNDER INSPECTION
LIP SMACKING ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO STOP THEM FROM GETTING TO THEIR DESTINATION ARE ALTHOUGH PLAUSIBLE A LITTLE WEAK
EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASED ON WHETHER SHE GETS TO DUBLIN IN TIME YOURE NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE GETS THERE
LIP SMAKCING A LOT OF THIS MOVIE BRINGS A CUTE LAUGH HERE AND THERE
AND BOTH THE ACTORS AMY ADAMS AND MATTHEW GOODE WORK WELL WITH EACH OTHER
AND SEEM TO BE REALLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
EVEN WHEN THEYRE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE THOUGH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ITS THEIR BANTER NOT ACTUAL DISLIKE
ALL IN ALL IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A CUTE ROMANTIC COMEDY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING THEN THIS WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD MOVIE FOR YOU
I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I LOVE YOU
ALTHOUGH BROOKE DID A A UNIQUE MOVIE LAST TUESDAY
NOW I HAD NO IDEA HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE WAS GONNA BE
UM I SHOULDNT SAY LIKE ITS NOT LIKE AMAZINGLY GONNA WIN SOME AWARDS GOOD
BUT ITS SUCH A FEEL GOOD COMEDY
NOW THE REAL STEVEN RUSSEL HAS LIKE AN IQ LIKE 000 WHICH IS LIKE WOW GENIOUS
I MEAN SOME PEOPLE LIKE JAMES WOODS I BELIEVE HIS IQ IS 0 000 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
JIM CARRY IAN MCGREGGOR I LIKED THE TWO OF THEM
I THINK THEY ARE VERY GOOD ACTORS
IAN MCGREGGOR HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES
AND JIM CARRY UM I KIND OF LIGHT WENT OFF I LOVE UM I USED TO IMMITATE HIS COMEDY STYLE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BELIEVE IT OR NOT
I MEAN HE EVEN FAKED HAVING AIDS TO GET OUT OF PRISON
IF YOURE UM A LOVER OF JIM CARRY A LOVER OF IAN MCGRAGGOR THAN YOULL LIKE THIS MOVIE
UM NOW PLEASE I LOVE MOVIES
I LOVE ALL ASPECTS OF MOVIES
BUT THIS IS KIND OF
AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I CAN SAY WAS DEFINATELLY DISAPPOINTED
I LOVE THE FIRST SHREK AND THE SECOND SHREK
AND I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THIS ONE BE JUST AS GOOD
AND IT JUST THAT IT HADNT ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER
I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT
I MEAN I WENT IN THERE HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND FUNNY LIKE THE FIRST TWO
AND IT OFFERED NOTHING OF THE SUCH
IT WASNT REMOTLY FUNNY
THERE WAS A FEW JOKES OK YEAH MAKE YOU GIGGLE OR SOMETHING
BUT THATS NOTHING MAJOR
NOTHING REALLY THAT FUNNY
OR ANYTHING ORIGINAL
THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THE SAME
AND NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES
AND I LOVED PUSS IN BOOTS
AND HE WASNT EVEN THAT GREAT THIS TIME AROUND
THE DONKEY AND PUSS IN BOOTS RIVALRY THATS GOING ON IT JUST IT WASNT AS FUNNY THE THIRD TIME AROUND
AND THERE WAS NOTHING NEW TO OFFER
PLAIN AND SIMPLY IT WAS DULL FOR ME
IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER I I COULDVE I SAW IT BEING SO MUCH BETTER IN MY HEAD BUT IT JUST WASNT
IT DISAPPOINTED ME HIGHLY
AND I WAS JUST SORT OF DISCOURAGED AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE
AND IM DEFINATELLY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK
UM IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME
AND I DONT SUGGEST ANYONE GO SEE IT
IF YOURE HOPING TO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND YOURE FORCED TO GO WHICH YOU PROBABLY WILL IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU KNOW PUT UP WITH IT AS A PARENT
BUT ON YOUR OWN DONT GO SEE IT
ITS NOT REALLY THAT GREAT
EVERYONE IS SPLIT ON THIS ONE JUST AS THEY WERE ON SPIDERMAN
AND JUST THEY ARE WITH ALL THE OTHER SEQUELS THAT ARE COMING OUT AN THIS ONE
I HAVE TO AGREE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE IT WAS NOT GREAT
IT WASNT EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
I MEAN THERES A FEW MOMENTS YEAH THAT ARE ORIGINAL AND FUNNY
AND THERES A NE AN INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CHARACTER JUSTINE TIMBERLAKES CHARACTER ALREADY IN THE FILM
BUT THEY DIDNT EVEN GIVE HIM THAT MUCH TO DO THE HE HAD ONLY FEW MINOR LINES
AND NONE OF THEM WERE REALLY THAT GREAT I MEAN STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND
SO THE ADDITION OF THIS CHARACTER WAS PRETTY POINTLESS
I MEAN ITS PLEASENT TO THE STORY
BUT I STILL FIND IT POINTLESS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE
AND THE CHARACTERS JUST WERENT THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT JUST KIND OF MADE ME WANNA REALLY WALK OUT OF THE THEATER
SO THAT JUST PISSED ME OFF MORE
BUT REALLY I COULDVE SHOULDVE JUST WALKED UP AND LEFT AT THAT MOMENT
IT WAS BORING
AND NOT AT ALL ORIGINAL IN MY OPINION
IT COULDVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE SECOND SEQUEL WAS REALLY GREAT
AND I LOVED IT AND THIS ONE JUST WAS A FLAT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS
SO IM GONNA RATE THIS ONE TWO STARS
IT SHOULDVE REALLY BE ONE
BUT IM GONNA GIVE IT A TWO TO BE FAIR
BECAUSE THE MOVIE DID HAVE SOME POINTS WHEN I WAS LAUGHING
BUT VERY FEW
AND IT WASNT WORTH IT IN MY OPINION TO GO SEE IT
SO I DEFINATELLY SUGGEST
POOP
MUSIC IN BACKGROUND LAUGHING CURRENTLY IN THEATRES STARRING NO ONE YOUVE EVER HEARD OF
GUARDIANS OF OWL LAND WHATEVER THAT CAME OUT AND I NEVER SAW IT
AND THIS SUCKERS GETTING THIS SUCKER IS GETTING PANNED LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE PANNED AND I WANNA SAY THIS I DID NOT THINK IT WAS LIKE LAST AIRBENDER GARBAGE
UM HERES WHY YES STUTTERING T THERES PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND I WANNA TALK ABOUT THEM BUT YOU KNOW IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
THERE ARE SOME REALLY COOL UH MOMENTS IN THIS
IT ACTUALLY HAS SOME SOME THEM THEMATICALLY IT HAS SOME COOL THEMES ABOUT HEROISM AND ABOUT LIKE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF YOURSELF AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I RESONATED WITH AND I WHI AND WHICH I APPRECIATED
BUT HERES THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE THE ESSENTAIL PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE WELL MAYBE THIS WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT UM THERE WAS A UH A COMEDIAN NAMED DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND DAVE CHAPELLE UM AND ANOTHER COMEDIAN CHRIS ROCK ARE UM AFRICAN AMERICAN AND IN THEIR COMEDY THEY SOMETIMES TAKE ON AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND SO THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY MAKE FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE THING WITH DAVE CHAPELLE AND WITH CHRIS ROCK IS BECAUSE THEYRE BLACK THEY CAN KINDA DO THAT AND THERES SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THATS ACCEPTABLE
UM IF LIKE ME OR LAUGHING SOME OTHER WHITE PERSON OR HISPANIC PERSON OR WHATEVER DID THE SAME JOKES IT WOULD NOT BE FUNNY
IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE IN FACT IT WOULD BE RACIST
SO ZACH SNYDER HERE IS MAKING A MOVIE THATS OSTENSIBLY ABOUT FEMALE EMPOW EMPOWERMENT BUT ITS A MOVIE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF CLEARING THROAT SLAPPING THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF WOMEN IN BUSTIERS THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF VIOLENCE DONE AGAINST WOMEN AND ULTIMATELY IN WHICH MOST OF THE WOMEN END UP COMPLETELY DISEMPOWERED
CLAPPING LAUGHING SO OKAY IF ZACH SNYDER WERE A WOMAN I WOULD SAY OKAY SHES MAKING A COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY WOMEN CANT BE EMPOWERED IN MALE DOMINATED SOCIETIES IN THE WAY MEN UM DISTRACT AND AND HURT AND DAMAGE WOMEN AND PREVENT THEM FROM ASSERTING WHO THEY REALLY ARE
I COULD KINDA SEE THAT IN A SORT OF CHRIS ROCK DAVE CHAPELLE WAY
BUT ZACH SNYDER IS A GUY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS STUFF KINDA ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE THE SH HE MAN WOMAN HATERS CLUB
SO IF I GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT LOOKS GREAT HAS SOME BAD ACTING
AND HAS WAY TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
IF I DONT GIVE ZACH SNYDER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
WELL HE PLAYS THAT WELL SO HES A GOOD VILLAIN
HE ALSO HAS SOME REALLY COOL GUNS SO THAT ITS LIKE A DESERT EAGLE BUT IT HAS TO BARRELS TO IT
ITS PRETTY PRETTY SCARY LOOKING
I WOULDNT WANT THAT POINTED AT ME
AND I WHO WOULD I MEAN
UM LIKE I SAID I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT
THE ACTION THEY DO HAVE IS REALLY WELL DONE
UM THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH CAR
THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE FIGHT SCENES
AND I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT
AND I THOUGHT THAT THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE INCREDIBLE
AND I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT UM HOW ITS THE PERFORMANCES IN IT WERE SORT OF OVER OVERLOOKED AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS
BECAUSE UM THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT MOVIES THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR I MEAN UM THE KINGS SPEECH BLACK SWAN 000 HOURS INCEPTION
BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES OUT THIS YEAR
SOME OF THE GREAT PERFORMANCES UM OF LAST YEAR WERE KIND OF OVERLOOKED CUZ THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OF THEM
AND I THINK THAT BLUE VALENTINE HAS UM BECOME KIND OF UNDERRATED
AND ITS TRULY HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THAT CONTRASTED WITH THE STATE OF THINGS
AND THERES A LOTS OF SMACKING LIPS THERES SO MANY DYNAMICS GOING ON WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK THAT IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT STORY
AND ITS SORT OF LIKE A CONTRIVED PLOT THATS BEEN USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BECAUSE ITS UM ITS AN AUDIENCE PLEASER YOU KNOW
AN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANTIC DRAMAS LIKE THUMPING ITS UH IT GETS THE AUDIENCES TO THEATRES BECAUSE ITS A COMPELLING IDEA BUT ITS BEEN UH DONE
BUT I DO WANNA TELL YOU ABOUT PRIEST
IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT HAS ANYTHING REALISTIC IN IT YOU SHOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS INSANE
IF YOU LIKE EXPLOSIONS REALLY RIDICULOUS ACTION SEQUENCES MALODRAMATIC PLOT AND ACTING THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVIE TO SEE
AND SHE ALSO HAS PRETTY SWEET MOVES
AND IS FUN TO WATCH
SOME REALLY FUN TOUCHES WITHIN THE MOVIE IS THAT TWO VAMPIRES IN OTHER SHOWS APPEAR IN THIS MOVIE NOT AS VAMPIRES
THERERE ALSO TWO LORD OF THE RINGS GRADS WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE
AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER
IF ALL THREE OF THEM WERE PUT TOGETHER
YEAH THATS ABOUT HOW MY FAVORITE LIST GOES
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS HES WORMTONGUE AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY
OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONES ARE CHRISTOPHER PLUMBER
AND SHE IS A REALLY PRETTY GIRL
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TYPES OF MOVIES
I REALLY LOVE THE MELODRAMATIC OVER THE TOP CRAZY ACTION SORT OF THING GOING ON
THERES S SCENE IN A CAVE WHERE THEY FIGHT A GIANT MONSTER THAT REALLY REMINDS ME OF LIKE SOME SORT OF LORD OF THE RINGS MINES OF MORIA MOMENT
AND THERES A BETTER ON TOP OF THE TRAIN FIGHTS THAN THE FIRST MISSION IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE
SO YES I REALLY ENJOYED IT
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUN
AND I ENJOYED MYSELF A LOT AT THE MOVIE
I LAUGHED AT QUITE A BIT OF THE DIALOGUE
AND THERE ACTUALLY WAS ONE SCENE THAT I FOUND KIN
NOW RANGO WAS JUST FANTASTIC
SURPRISED ME
UH IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
AND THIS TOWN WAS LIKE FROM A GOOD OLD WESTERN
IT HAD ALL THIS STEREOTYPICAL TRAITS OF A WESTERN TOWN
I DUNNO BUT IT WAS IT WAS COOL
IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE
AND NOW WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS LIKE THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE
THE ALL THE ANIMALS WERE JUST SO FUNNY
UM THEY ALL PLAYED OFF EACH OTHER
THEYRE LIKE THE DUMB KINDA COWBOYS THAT DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING ALWAYS ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS STAYING SAYING STUPID SHIT
AND IT WAS JUST OH IT WAS HYSTERICAL
AND THE STUFF HE SAID WAS JUST IT WAS JUST SO FUNNY
AND HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB
ALL THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IN THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT
LIKE ALL THE SUNSETS AND ALL THE LANDSCAPES OF THE FILMS THEY JUST LOOKED SO REALISTIC IN EVERY ALMOST EVERY SCENE
UM LIKE THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
THIS AW THIS ONE REALLY COOL ACTION SEQUENCES WHERE LIKE THIS RONNY UH JOHNNY DEPPS POSSE THEY WERE GETTING CHASED BY ALL THESE LIKE POSSUMS
OR NAH I WOULDNT SAY POSSUMS BUT PRAIRIE DOGS
IM NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THEY WERE
IT WAS JUST SO COOL
LIKE A COVERED WAGON HORSE KINDA COWBOY CHASE SEQUENCE
OH IT WAS SO COOL
UM BUT THIS MOVIE IT HAD EVERYTHING HUMOR ROMANCE ACTION
OF COURSE UM IT WAS JUST IT WAS FUN IT WAS A FUN ENTERTAINING MOVIE
UH IT WAS GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY
UM DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CHECKING SEEING THIS UH CHECKING THIS MOVIE OUT
UH I RATED IT FOUR OUT OF FIVE STARS
UM THE ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THEY BROUGHT THE MAIN CHARA UH THE BAD CHARACTER I SHOULD SAY IN KINDA LATE
BUT THAT DIDNT REALLY MATTER
UM EVERYTHING ELSE HELD UP ITS OWN
UM DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE RANGO UH IN A THEATRE NEAR YOU
UH I REALLY ENJOYED DOING THEM FOR THE PHILLY D MOVIE CLUB SO I THOUGHT OH WHY NOT
UH RANGO IS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE
UM I I LIKED A LOT OF THE MOVIE
I WILL ADMIT IM A BIG JOHNNY DEPP FAN
UM I PRETTY MUCH WILL GO SEE ANY MOVIE THAT KIND OF HAS AN INTERESTING PLOT IF HES IN IT
UM ITS NOT HIS BEST
I MEAN CORPSE BRIDE HES REALLY GOOD IN CORPSE BRIDE
AND RANGO KIND OF FALLS INTO THAT
WELL ITS A JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE SO ITS ENTERTAINING
BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD GO BUY
OR SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND
UNLESS YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS TO BRING WITH YOU
OH IT HAS SOME REALLY GOOD REFERENCES OF PAST JOHNNY DEPP FILMS IN IT LIKE WHILE THE CHAMELEONS GETTING BOUNCED ALONG THE HIGHWAY YOU RUN INTO HENRY S THOMPSON
UH HES SUPER ENTERTAINING AS THE CHAMELEON
I MEAN JOHNNY DEPPS A WONDERFUL VOICE ACTOR SO UM HE HES I DO HES AN INCREDIBLE VOICE ACTOR
LIKE THATS REALLY THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS LISTENING TO HIM UH PULL OFF ALL THESE DIFFERENT VOICES
AND BE THIS REALLY QUIRKY LITTLE CHAMELEON
UM I I WOULD YEAH I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS
BUT IF YOU DONT REALLY HAVE ANY SMALL FRIENDS UH THAT SOUNDED REALLY PERVERTED SMALL CHILDREN THAT YOU ARE RELATED TO UM TO TAKE TO THE MOVIES UH I WOULDNT GO SEE IT BY MYSELF
I DEFINITELY WILL BUY IT
BUT UH IT WAS WORTH THE FREE MOVIE PASSES THAT I USED ON IT
AND THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME RAMBLE
BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO SEE IT ACTUALLY
AND UM FIRST OF ALL I I ACTUALLY WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF THE JI JOE TV SERIES
OR BIG COLLECTOR OF THE ACTION FIGURES
BUT I WASNT BIG ON IT UM
JI JOE RISE OF THE COBRA UM THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE CHEEZY
BUT IN THE GOOD WAY I IN IST THERES TWO TYPES OF CHEEZY AND THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF CHEEZY
YES IT THE ACTING IS A LITTLE ROUGH IN SOME PARTS
WELL YOU KNOW UM CORNY
BUT THE M THE SCRIPT IS CORNY
I MEAN THE WAY ITS WRITTEN IS CORNY
I MEAN I DIDNT GO TO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING TO SEE THE DARK NIGHT
AND QUITE HONESTLY I WISH IVE SEEN THIS OVER THE SUMMER
BECAUSE IF IVE SEEN IT OVER THE SUMMER I PROBABLY WOULDVE RATED IT BEST ACTION MOVIE I SAW THIS SUMMER
THIS SUMMER WAS KIND OF WEIRD WITH THE ACTION MOVIES IF YOU ASK ME
I DID LIKE TRANSFORMERS 0 EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDNT LIKE THAT
BUT YOU KNOW THIS MOVIE UM THIS REALLY UM WOULDVE MADE UP FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT HAD A TERMINATOR SALVATION
AND UM YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS
IN YOU KNOW THEYRE IN THERE THIS IS A CHEEZY UM MOVIE
SO YOU KNOW ITS NOT LIKE YOU ACTUALLY GETTING LIKE ACADEMY AWARD QUALITY ACTING PERFORMANCES
UM AND NOW THE PERFORMANCES ARE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE TO WRITE HOME ABOUT
UM THAT BEING SAID YOU CAN TELL THAT LOT PEOPLE WERE HAVING FUN WITH THIS
AND I XXX LIKE IN PARTICULAR JOSEPH JOSEPH GORDONLEVITT HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HIS ROLE
I THINK UM RACHEL NICHOLS HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH HER ROLE
MARLON WAYANS HAD A LOT OF FUN
BUT THE GUY FROM LOST HAD A LOT OF FUN
DENNIS QUAID I THINK HAD A LOT OF FUN
UM SAME WITH CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON
SO I I THINK IT WAS COOL TO ACTUALLY SEE RAY PARK IN ACTION GREAT ACTION STAR
HE DOES A GREAT JOB WITH HIS SNAKE EYES WHICH IS ALWAYS COOL TO SEE THAT
JOE MOVIE IS HOW INTERNATIONAL IT WAS IT WAS VERY DIVERT
NOT GREAT
SIGH I REALLY THINK WHAT THIS WAS MISSING WAS THAT HUMOR AND THAT WIT THAT THAN THE OTHER SHREK MOVIES
UM ITS JUST NOT THERE
ITS OKAY
BUT ITS REALLY NOT WONDERFUL
NOTHING TO RUSH OUT AND SEE
THERE ARENT A LOT OF KIDS MOVIES OUT RIGHT NOW SO
AND I GUESS NORMALLY SHREK IS FOR ADULTS
BUT LACK YOU KNOW VERY LACKLUSTER
CHUCKLE BE FOREWARNED LOW EXPECTATIONS
OKAY AND NOW ITS LATE
BUT LET ME FIRST SAY THIS I LIKED IT MORE THAN I EXPECTED I WOULD
THIS FILM IS SLAVISHLY DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL BOOK OR NOV NOVELLA UH BY UH CHARLES DICKENS
NUMBER ONE IT MEANS ITS MUCH SCARIER THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE
MY 0 YEAR OLD WAS TERRIFIED THROUGH PART OF THIS BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS TERRIFYING
LET ME SAY THIS IF YOUR CHRISTIANITY IS EXTREMELY LEGALISTIC THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU
CAUSE THIS IS A FILM THAT BASICALLY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE JESUS TOLD US TO TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE AND IF YOU DONT TAKE CARE OF POOR PEOPLE YOURE GONNA BURN IN HELL
SO LAUGHING IF THATS YOUR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY ITS A CHRISTIAN FILM
UM ITS NOT MY FORM
UM ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS IN ITS DEVOTION IS THAT SOMETIMES MY CHILDREN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BEING SAID BECAUSE THEY WERE SPEAKING DICKENSONIAN ENGLISH
SOMETIMES I MISSED WHAT WAS BEING SAID
THEREFORE A LOT OF SOCIAL COMMENTARY GOES WOOP SOUND EFFECT OVER YOUR HEAD
OR JUST REALLY DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO US TODAY AT ALL
UM ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT DEBTORS PRISON FOR INSTANCE DOESNT REALLY UM JIVE HERE IN 00ST CENTURY AMERICA
AND THIS FILM IS THIS AMAZING LIKE I SAY SLAVISH DEVOTION TO CHARLES DICKENS WITH AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE
BECAUSE THIS THING IS IS MEANT TO BE SEEN IN 0D
AND THROUGHOUT THE FILM YOURE GOING SOUND EFFECTS LAUGHING EITHER FROM THE TERRIFYING CHARACTERS
OR MOST LIKELY FROM GOING VERY QUICKLY THROUGH LONDON WITH YOU KNOW DEMON HORSES CHASING YOU SO UH THERES THAT
ALSO ABOUT THE ANIMATION THE PEOPLE JUST LIKE IN POLAR EXPRESS A FILM I REALLY DID NOT LIKE
UM THE PEOPLE SEEMED SORT OF DEAD
EXCEPT THEIR EYES ARE KIND OF LIKE THIS WELCOME TO THE POLAR EXPRESS
AND THATS A LOT TO BE SAID FOR A ONE MINUTE REVIEW
I ACTUALLY LIKE THE FILM
UM I ENJOYED MYSELF IN IT YOU MIGHT AS WELL
I WOULD NOT TAKE A YOUNG CHILD
ROBIN HOOD STARRING RUSSEL CROW UM FIRST THING I GOT TO SAY XXX I WAS DREADING GOING IN TO SEE THIS MOVIE
THE TRAILERS WERENT REALLY DOING IT MUCH FOR ME
SO I REALLY WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE
UM BUT I GUESS SAY MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BY THESE OTHER REVIEWS THAT I READ
BUT I DIDNT MIND IT
BUT I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT BAD
I DIDNT FIND IT ALL THAT GOOD
LIKE I SAID MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE LOWERED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE REVIEWS BUT I REALLY DIDNT HATE IT
LIKE WHAT PEOPLE COULD HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVES TO SAY THE LEAST
UM REALLY FIRST AND FOREMOST IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THESE PAST ROBIN HOOD MOVIES THAT WE KNOW
THERES MEN IN TIGHTS WHICH YOU KNOW HILARIOUS SPOOF OF THE STORY
THERES A KEVIN COSTNER PRINCE OF FEE VERSION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DARK AND EDGY VERSION OF HIS TIME I MEAN BUT THAT WAS WHAT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO FOURTEEN YEARS AGO PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT
AND IT JUST LACKED THE CHARM OF THOSE PAST MOVIES
IT DID SEEM TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON EPIC EPIC EPIC
AND IT REALLY JUST LACKED WHAT MADE THE OTHER MOVIES MORE ENJOYABLE
AND SUFFERS FROM WHAT I CALL KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SYNDROM WHERE IT BUILDS TOO MUCH FOR THESE HUGE CATASTROPHIC WAR SEQUENCES THEYRE SUPPOSED TO BLOW YOU AWAY BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU DONT GIVE A DAMN BECAUSE IT JUST LACKS THAT CHARM OF THE PAST MOVIES
UM NOT IN ALL INSTANCES BUT THE ONES THAT MATTER THE MOST YEAH
UM RUSSEL CROW AND CATE BLANCHETTE JUST DID NOT SELL IT FOR ME I HAD A VERY HARD TIME JUST BUYING IT
LIKE WERE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO ARE IN THEIR MID WEL YOU KNOW MID THIRTIES AT THE OLDEST AND LAUGHTER THEYRE LOOKING PRETTY ROUGH IN THIS MOVIE
I CAN APPRECIATE THAT
HES NOT GONNA BE LOOKING LIKE A CHIPPER BRIGHT YOUNG MAN BUT EARLY THIRTIES REALLY YOU WANT ME TO BUY THAT
I CANT DO IT
ESPECIALLY WHEN HES HANGING AROUND WITH A MARRIED MEN WHO ALL BUT ONE OF THEM ARE PROBABLY EARLY TWENTIES LAUGHTER AND ONE OF THEM IS MAYBE MID TWENTIES AND MEANWHILE THEYRE HANGING IN WITH PAPA RUSSEL IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW ITS BUNCH OF A GUYS HANGING THERE SO ONE BROUGHT DAD ALONG COZ HE OFFERED TO DRIVE
SAVE YOUR MONEY WAIT TIL IT COMES OUT ON RENTAL
FOR ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME
THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY LINES
BUT AFTER AN HOUR I JUST SAID ENOUGH I HAD TO WALK OUT
THE MOVIE THEATRE GAVE ME CREDIT TO A FUTURE MOVIE SO THAT I APPRECIATE IT
UH IF YOU LIKE THE KIND OF MOVIE THAT BEN STILLER DID A NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD LIKE SOMETHING UH LIKE THIS
UH IF YOU DIDNT LIKE THAT TYPE OF MOVIE THEN I REALLY DONT THINK YOURE GONNA LIKE THIS AT ALL
AND YOURE BETTER OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY UH AND MAYBE RENTING IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON UH VIDEO SO
BUT UH THERES DEFINITELY FAR BETTER MOVIES THAT YOU CAN UH GO SEE THAN UM TONGUE CLICKING THAN ZOOKEEPER
IM GONNA START OFF WITH SAYING THAT I REALLY WASNT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE
AND I LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE I THOUGHT THE FIRST MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD
BUT THIS MOVIE KIND OF CAME OFF LIKE SOMEBODYS REALLY SAD TRAVEL VIDEO I DONT KNOW
I MEAN THAT SOUNDS REALLY HARSH
BUT I JUST WASNT I JUST I DONT KNOW I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THE MOVIE ALL THAT MUCH
I MEAN I HAD SOME SOME GOOD MOMENTS
AND A FEW FUNNY PARTS
BUT ALL IN ALL I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY OVER OVERLY SAD
I DONT KNOW I JUST THOUGHT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REALLY SAD
UM I MEAN IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE SHOW AND YOU REALLY LIKED THE FIRST MOVIE AND YOU STILL WANNA GO AND SEE THIS IM NOT GONNA DISCOURAGE YOU FROM SEEING IT
I JUST PERSONALLY I JUST DIDNT REALLY ENJOY IT
UM IT ALSO REALLY DIDNT NEED A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT IT HAD IN IT
LIKE IT COULDVE BEEN SHORTER
BUT A LOT OF THE FOOTAGE WAS KIND OF UNNECESSARY
AND I MEAN I DONT KNOW I JUST I FEEL LIKE I DONT MEAN IF I HAVE WASTED THOSE TWO HOURS I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULDVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER WITH THEM
I THINK THAT CHARLOTTE AND MIRANDA HAVE SOME REALLY NICE MOMENTS IN THE MOVIE
I REALLY THINK THAT I REALLY LIKE THE MIRANDAS CHARACTER
ACTUALLY THE MOST UPBEAT CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE MOVIE
I THINK THAT UM AND THAT EVERYBODY I DO FEEL REALLY BAD FOR CHARLOTTE
SHE DOES HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES
AND YOU REALLY CAN KIND OF SYMPHATIZE WHETHER YOUVE GOT TO HAVE KIDS
I MEAN EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE KIDS
BECAUSE ITS JUST JUST ABOUT GETTING GETTING TIME FOR YOURSELF
AND NOT BEING REALLY STRESSED OUT
AND I THINK THAT THATS THATS A VERY RELATABLE ISSUE
I THINK THAT THEY ALL HAVE LIKE A LOT OF ISSUES
AND THAT SOME ARE VERY RELATABLE
YEAH I MEAN IT IT HAS SOME FUN MOMENTS
BUT ALL IN ALL WASNT REALLY THAT BIG OF A FAN
BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASNT ALL THAT MUCH TO IT FOR ME
UM LIKE I SAID IF YOU LIKE IT FEEL FREE TO GO SEE IT I JUST PERSONALLY WASNT THAT INTO IT
UM YEAH I MEAN IF YOU WANNA SEE A VIDEO UM ITS GONNA BE WHO ENJOYED A FILM
IF YOU DO WANNA SEE SOMEBODY WHOS POSSIBLY CRITIQUING IT
AND SHE REALLY ENJOYED THE FILM
UM SO IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR A UM LIKE MORE POSITIVE REVIEW CHECK OUT HER REVIEW IT IS VERY GOOD
NINE NINETY SCREENING PLUS I AM NUMBER FOUR YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THAT
I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THIS MOVIE
BUT I WENT AND I DIG THIS MOVIE
I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT
PLUS I HAD A GOOD TIME
IM WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE
THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD ITS REALLY GOOD SOME REALLY GREAT SONGS
AND THE BEST THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT ALL TWO SONGS UM WELL NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE NOT WELL WELL CONNECTED WITH THE SCENES
UM ANYWAYS THE MUSIC IS GOOD
ITS STUTTERING THAT IS A GOOD THING
I REALLY DIG THE SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THIS MOVIE
LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE IT STARTS WITH REALLY GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES
AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS
AND THE ENDING WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT TOO
ITS IT WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE MOVIE
THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIE IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS SO CHEESY
I MEAN THE BLOOD IS LIKE TWILIGHT WITH SOME SCIFI WITH SOME ACTION AND WITH LIKABLE CHARACTERS AND THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT GUYS
THE CHARACTERS OF I AM NUMBER FOUR ARE LIKABLE
NOT LIKE THE CHARACTERS OF OF TWILIGHT
UM THE ENDING IS OPEN FOR A SEQUEL
AND UH I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE A SEQUEL OF THIS MOVIE
BECAUSE I REALLY DIG THIS MOVIE
I REALLY DIG THIS MOVIE
THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS REALLY GREAT
I WILL EVEN PICK UP THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY
I WILL EVEN PICK UP THIS MOVIE ON BLURAY UM ANYWAYS UM THE MOVIE FOR ME IS THREE STARTS OUT OF FIVE STARS THREE SOLID STARS
CAUSE I HAD A GOOD TIME
AND UH THIS MOVIE I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THIS MOVIE
BUT IT WAS REALLY GOOD
THE ACTING IS ITS NORMAL ITS NOT BAD ITS NOT BAD AT ALL
THE LIKABLE CHARACTERS MAKE THIS MOVIE A REALLY GOOD MOVIE
IM WILLING TO GO WITH FRIENDS ALONE WITH FAMILY TO WATCH ON A RAINY DAY AND IF YOU CAN WATCH IT AT HALF PRICE AT A MIDNIGHT SHOW SCREENING
CAUSE ITS WORTH IT
SO YEAH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEKEND GO WATCH IT WATCH THIS MOVIE
